# Effort Matrix — Typical Remediation Estimates

## How to Use This Matrix

Each dimension has common remediation patterns. Use this matrix to estimate effort when bridging gaps. Actual effort varies by codebase size and complexity; these are baselines for a typical MicroSaaS/B2B SaaS project (10-50 pages, Supabase + Next.js stack).
