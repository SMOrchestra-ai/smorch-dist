## File 3: brd.md

Business Requirements Document: the primary input for all Step 5 development skills.

```markdown
# Business Requirements Document - [Venture Name]

## 1. Product Overview
[From companyprofile.md: what the product does, who it serves]

## 2. User Stories
[Derived from icp.md: minimum 10 user stories in standard format]
As a [persona], I want to [action], so that [outcome].

### MVP User Stories (Must Ship)
[5-8 stories that define the minimum viable product]

### Launch User Stories (Ship by Public Launch)
[3-5 stories needed for a credible public launch]

### Post-Traction User Stories (Build After PMF)
[5+ stories for after the first 20 paying customers]

## 3. Functional Requirements
[Organized by feature area. Each requirement has:]
- ID: FR-001
- Description: [What the system must do]
- Priority: MVP / LAUNCH / POST-TRACTION
- Acceptance Criteria: [Testable conditions]
- Dependencies: [Other requirements or integrations needed]

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: [Response times, concurrent users]
- Security: [Auth, data protection, HTTPS]
- i18n: [Arabic RTL, language switching, content translation]
- Accessibility: [WCAG level, Arabic screen reader support]
- Scalability: [Traffic expectations, data growth]

## 5. Technical Constraints
[From founderprofile.md and market-analysis.md]
- Budget: [Monthly infrastructure budget]
- Team: [Solo founder / small team capabilities]
- Timeline: [90-day roadmap from strategy.md]
- Market: [MENA-specific constraints]

## 6. MVP Scope Definition
[Explicit boundary: what is IN the MVP and what is OUT]

### In Scope
[Bulleted list with rationale]

### Out of Scope (Deferred)
[Bulleted list with when to revisit]

## 7. Success Metrics
[From strategy.md: what metrics prove the MVP works]
- Revenue: [Target MRR by Month 3]
- Users: [Target active users]
- Engagement: [Key product metrics]
```

Which MCPs and third-party services the product should support.

```markdown
# MCP Integration Plan - [Venture Name]

## Integration Overview
[Which external services the product connects to and why]

## MVP-Critical Integrations
| Service | Purpose | API Type | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
[Table of must-have integrations]

## Launch-Day Integrations
[Same format, lower priority]

## Post-Traction Integrations
[Same format, deferred]

## MCP Server Candidates
[If the student's product could benefit from Claude MCP integration:]
- Which data/services could be exposed via MCP
- Estimated build effort
