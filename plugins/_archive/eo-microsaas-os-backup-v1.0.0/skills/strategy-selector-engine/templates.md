## MOVEMENT BRIEF PROMPTS

**Purpose:** Articulate the founder's larger purpose and positioning narrative. This section feeds from the Conversational Advisor Framework's movement-brief.md deliverable.

**Prompts to populate in output:**

| Question | Purpose | Example Output |
|---|---|---|
| **What cause does this founder champion?** | Identify the larger mission beyond the product | "Democratize financial compliance for MENA SMEs" or "Return autonomy to finance teams over-burdened by manual processes" |
| **What's the New Opportunity (vs. Improvement Offer)?** | Distinguish if founder is improving existing category or opening new market | New Opportunity: "MENA founders now can scale without hiring FP&A teams" vs. Improvement: "Faster ZATCA reporting than competitors" |
| **Who's the enemy?** | Identify the specific problem or system the founder opposes | "Manual spreadsheet workflows that consume 20 hours/week" or "Global SaaS vendors who don't understand MENA tax requirements" |
| **What future are they building?** | Vision for how the world changes if their product wins | "MENA companies compete globally without compliance overhead" or "Finance teams spend time on strategy, not data entry" |

**AI Processing:** Movement Brief is synthesized from:
1. Founder's stated purpose in SC1 (if available)
2. ICP pain + amplification from SC2
3. Market opportunity positioning from SC3
4. Strategy path selection + Attractive Character archetype (from SC4)

Store Movement Brief in `strategy-recommendation.md` as narrative framing for all downstream GTM activities (SC5).

## FREE-TEXT RESPONSE EXAMPLES

### B5. Strategy Path Hypothesis -- Display Example

**Question:** Based on your market, which of the 4 strategy paths feels most natural? Why?

**Example Response:**
"I think Consulting-First SaaS is best because: (1) My ICP is in Egypt where business relationships are critical; consulting builds trust first. (2) Market is emerging (competitors aware but not many); early adopters willing to pay for guidance. (3) I have sales skills but not technical skills. (4) Conservative risk tolerance; need revenue in 90 days; consulting is fastest path."

---

### C5. ICP-Strategy Synthesis -- Display Example

**Question:** Looking at your ICP's buying behavior, pain urgency, and budget--does your chosen strategy (from B5) still make sense? Or would you reconsider?

**Example Response:**
"My ICP (finance managers at mid-market Saudi companies) show: Complex decision (finance team + CFO); 1-month urgency (ZATCA deadline); $150-500/month budget; reachable via LinkedIn + WhatsApp. My Consulting-First path still makes sense because: (1) Complex decisions require relationship building that consulting provides. (2) ZATCA urgency means they want expert guidance, not DIY SaaS. (3) Mid-market budget supports $200-300/month consulting model. (4) LinkedIn + WhatsApp are perfect channels for direct outreach."
