## Quality Gates

```
Gate 1: Scorecards/Templates ---> Brain Ingestion
  REQUIRES: SC1+SC2 uploaded OR 8 templates filled

Gate 2: Brain Files ---> GTM/Architecture
  REQUIRES: 12 brain files with 200+ chars each

Gate 3: Architecture ---> Development
  REQUIRES: brd.md + tech-stack-decision.md

Gate 4: QA ---> Security
  REQUIRES: qa-report.md with PASS status

Gate 5: Security ---> Deploy
  REQUIRES: security-audit.md with zero CRITICAL
```

## Time Estimates

| Step | Estimated Time | Environment |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Step 0: Scorecards | 2-4 hours | Web browser |
| Step 1: Brain Ingestion | 30-60 minutes | Cowork |
| Step 2: GTM Assets | 1-2 hours | Cowork |
| Step 3: Skill Extraction | 1-2 hours | Cowork |
| Step 4: Architecture | 1-2 hours | Claude Code |
| Step 5a: Database | 30-60 minutes | Claude Code |
| Step 5b: App Build | 2-6 hours | Claude Code |
| Step 5c: API Integration | 1-3 hours | Claude Code |
| Step 5d: QA | 1-2 hours | Claude Code |
| Step 5e: Security | 30-60 minutes | Claude Code |
| Step 5f: Deploy | 1-2 hours | Claude Code |
| **TOTAL** | **10-24 hours** | |

## Parallel Paths

Steps 2 and 3 can run in parallel (both only need brain files).
Steps 5a-5c are sequential but 5b calls 5a and 5c internally.
Steps 5d, 5e, 5f are strictly sequential (each gates the next).
