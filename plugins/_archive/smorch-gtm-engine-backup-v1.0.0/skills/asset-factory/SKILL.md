# Asset Factory

## Purpose

This sub-skill is the **production workhorse** that transforms 3 validated wedges into complete multi-channel campaign assets. It generates **42 assets** per campaign across email, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and social media.

**Core Philosophy**: High-volume, signal-based content that maintains quality and ICP resonance at scale.

**Reference Files:**
- [channel-templates.md](channel-templates.md) - Email, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and social post templates by ICP, merge field mapping

- **Mode A (New Campaign)**: Fourth sub-skill called (after wedge-generator)
- **Mode B (Weekly Assets)**: When generating weekly asset bundles

Directly invoke when user asks:
- "Generate email sequences for these wedges"
- "Create LinkedIn messages for [campaign]"
- "Produce all campaign assets"
- "Generate A/B variants for Week 2"

## Email Sequence Structure

### 3-Email Sequence (Days 1, 3, 6)

**Email 1: Education (The Gap)**
- Subject: Wedge-derived hook
- Body: Identify problem, introduce gap
- CTA: Soft (reply, resource, conversation)
- Length: 100-150 words
- P.S.: Micro-commitment or social proof

**Email 2: Proof (The Evidence)**
- Subject: Case study or data hook
- Body: Proof (peer success, data, testimonial)
- CTA: Medium (demo, assessment, meeting)
- Length: 120-180 words
- P.S.: Objection handling or urgency

**Email 3: Urgency (The Invitation)**
- Subject: Direct invitation
- Body: Clear next step, remove friction
- CTA: Direct (book meeting, start trial)
- Length: 80-120 words
- P.S.: Final nudge or scarcity

### A/B Variant Strategy

**Variant A: Data-Driven** - Leads with numbers, metrics, ROI. Proof-heavy. Direct language.
**Variant B: Story-Driven** - Leads with narrative, scenario. Emotion-forward. Relational language.

For full email templates by ICP, see [channel-templates.md](channel-templates.md).

---

## LinkedIn Sequence Structure

### 2-Message Sequence

**Message 1: Connection Request (280 characters max)**
- Personalized hook (mutual connection, shared content, signal observation)
- Soft value hint
- Clear reason for connection

**Message 2: Follow-Up (1-2 days after connection accepted)**
- Reference wedge
- Proof or insight
- Soft CTA (resource, conversation)

For full LinkedIn templates by ICP, see [channel-templates.md](channel-templates.md).

---

## WhatsApp Message Structure

### 3 Variants: A/B/C Psychology

**Variant A: Pattern Interrupt** - Unexpected angle, contrarian take, curiosity-driven
**Variant B: Problem Amplification** - Pain-forward, cost of inaction, urgency-driven
**Variant C: Peer Reference** - Social proof, trust-building, community-driven

For full WhatsApp templates by ICP, see [channel-templates.md](channel-templates.md).

---

## Social Post Structure

### 1 Post Per Week (LinkedIn/Twitter)

**Purpose**: Visibility (support outbound with inbound), thought leadership, social proof

**Format**:
- Hook (first line = wedge-derived)
- Body (insight, data, story)
- CTA (comment, engage, DM)
- Length: 150-250 words (LinkedIn), 280 characters (Twitter)

---

## A/B Variant Psychology

### Variant A: Data-First
- **Best for**: US markets, intent-driven buyers, analytical personas
- Leads with numbers, uses stats/case studies, direct CTA

### Variant B: Story-First
- **Best for**: MENA markets, trust-driven buyers, relationship-oriented personas
- Leads with narrative, uses peer stories, soft CTA

---

## Geographic Tone Adaptation

### MENA Tone
- High-context (implied vs explicit), "we" language, relationship references
- Sequence length: Longer (5-7 touches), Channel priority: WhatsApp > Email > LinkedIn

### US Tone
- Low-context (explicit, direct), "you" language, data-driven
- Sequence length: Shorter (3 emails), Channel priority: Email > LinkedIn

### Germany Tone
- Very low-context (hyper-explicit, structured), formal, evidence-heavy
- Sequence length: Longer (5-7 emails with white papers), Channel priority: Email only
