# GHL Operator Skill Test 4 — Mode F (Search & Query) Execution Flow
## Request: "Show me all contacts tagged 'signal:hot' that don't have a meeting booked — I need to follow up."

**Test Date:** 2026-02-21
**Mode:** F (Search & Query)
**Skill:** ghl-operator

---

## 1. REQUEST ANALYSIS & INTENT MAPPING

### User Request Breakdown
```
Query: "Show me all contacts tagged 'signal:hot' that don't have a meeting booked"
Follow-up intent: Need actionable contact list for outreach
```

### Decision Points

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Which contacts? | Those tagged `signal:hot` | Primary search filter |
| Exclusion criteria? | Without `meeting_booked` status | Secondary filter |
| What does "meeting booked" mean? | `status:meeting_booked` tag OR `meeting_date` custom field populated | Two possible search patterns |
| Result scope? | All such contacts (no date limit implied) | Search across entire contact database |
| Output format? | User said "follow up" → actionable list with contact info | Structured summary with contact names, tags, signal scores |

### Mode Identification
✓ **Confirmed Mode F** — Search & Query
- Trigger: "Show me all contacts"
- Pattern: Filter by tag + custom field condition
- Action: Search, summarize results, recommend follow-up actions

## 2. HOW TO SEARCH CONTACTS BY signal:hot TAG VIA MCP

### MCP Tool Selection
**Tool:** `mcp__ghl-mcp__search_contacts`

### Tool Signature & Parameters
```
Function: mcp__ghl-mcp__search_contacts(
  query: string,           # Search query — can include tags
  email: string,           # Optional: filter by email
  phone: string,           # Optional: filter by phone
  limit: number            # Max results (default 25, max 100)
)

Returns: {
  contacts: [{
    id,
    firstName,
    lastName,
    email,
    phone,
    tags: string[],        # Includes signal:hot, status:*, etc.
    customFields: {},      # Includes meeting_date, signal_score, etc.
    ...
  }],
  pagination: {...}        # If >limit results
}
```

### Implementation

#### Step 1: Primary Search by Tag
```javascript
// MCP Call 1: Get all signal:hot contacts
mcp__ghl-mcp__search_contacts({
  query: "signal:hot",
  limit: 100  // Fetch in one batch (max 100)
})
```

**Rationale:**
- The GHL search_contacts tool accepts `query` parameter that matches tags
- `signal:hot` is a standard tag in tag-taxonomy.md
- `limit: 100` captures most results in a single call; if results are paginated, pagination tokens will be included in response

---

## 3. HOW TO FILTER FOR THOSE WITHOUT meeting_booked STATUS

### Challenge
The search_contacts MCP tool does **not** have a native "exclude tag" parameter. Therefore, the filtering strategy requires client-side post-processing:

### Filtering Logic

```python
# After receiving signal:hot contacts from MCP call
def filter_without_meeting_booked(contacts):
    """
    Exclude contacts that already have a meeting booked.
    Check two possible indicators:
    1. Has status:meeting_booked tag
    2. Has meeting_date custom field (non-empty)
    """
    unbooked = []
    for contact in contacts:
        has_meeting_booked_tag = 'status:meeting_booked' in contact.tags
        has_meeting_date = (
            contact.customFields.get('meeting_date')
            and contact.customFields['meeting_date'] != ""
        )

        if not (has_meeting_booked_tag or has_meeting_date):
            unbooked.append(contact)

    return unbooked
```

### Decision Tree for "Meeting Booked" State
```
Contact has 'status:meeting_booked' tag?
  ├─ YES → EXCLUDE (meeting is confirmed)
  └─ NO → Check custom field

Contact has meeting_date custom field populated?
  ├─ YES (non-empty) → EXCLUDE (meeting scheduled)
  └─ NO → INCLUDE in follow-up list
```

**Why both checks?**
- According to tag-taxonomy.md: `status:meeting_booked` should be applied when meeting confirmed
- According to contact-operations.md: `meeting_date` custom field stores the scheduled appointment time (ISO 8601)
- Some contacts might have one but not the other during transition states; checking both ensures accuracy

     • Signal Score: 7 | Last Signal: 2026-02-19, 11:00 AM
     • Tags: signal:hot, source:instantly, icp:mena_sme
     • Action: ⚠️ Follow up soon — engagement 2 days old

  [... more contacts ...]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FOLLOW-UP RECOMMENDATIONS:
  • Channel Priority: WhatsApp (26 contacts, 76%) > Email (8 contacts, 24%)
  • Best Time: Sunday–Thursday, 9AM–6PM Gulf Time
  • Next Action: Tag those contacted today with signal:replied to track responses
  • Automation: Add uncontacted hot leads to "Hot Lead Follow-up" workflow
```

### Key Fields Always Included
1. **Contact name + email** (primary identity)
2. **Phone + channel tags** (communication method)
3. **Signal score + last signal date** (urgency indicator)
4. **Source tag** (context: where did they come from)
5. **ICP tag** (pipeline assignment)
6. **Recommended next action** (explicit CTA)

### Why This Format?
- Grouped by signal score (highest first) = prioritized follow-up
- Channel visibility (WhatsApp tag count) = MENA-specific best practice
- Timestamp tracking = prevents duplicate outreach
- Explicit next action = user doesn't need to think, just execute

---

## 6. FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS RECOMMENDED PER SKILL'S ANALYTICS PATTERNS

### Decision Tree: What Happens Next?

```
User sees results:
├─ "I want to follow up immediately"
│  └─ → Mode C (Messaging): Send WhatsApp/SMS to hot leads
│       • Filter by channel:whatsapp tag
│       • Use template: signal-based follow-up (brief, pattern interrupt)
│
├─ "I want to add them to a sequence"
│  └─ → n8n-architect skill (workflow automation)
│       • Trigger: Add to Hot Lead Follow-up workflow
│       • Sequence: WhatsApp → 2-day email → calendar link
│
├─ "I want to book meetings with them"
│  └─ → Mode E (Pipeline Management): Create opportunities
│       • Opportunity name: {Company} - {Contact Name}
│       • Pipeline: Based on ICP tag (icp:mena_saas → MENA SaaS Pipeline)
│       • Stage: "Qualified" (signal:hot warrants direct move past "Signal Detected")
│       • CTA: Send calendar booking link via WhatsApp
│
└─ "I want to analyze why some are not responding"
   └─ → Mode D (Analytics): Funnel analysis
       • Metric: Signal-to-Meeting Rate (% of signal:hot → booked meeting)
       • Benchmark: Track against historical conversion
       • Insight: If <30%, may need faster follow-up cadence or better message
```

### Analytics Patterns to Track (from analytics-patterns.md)

| Metric | How to Measure | Action if Below Threshold |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Signal-to-Meeting Rate** | (Contacts with status:meeting_booked) / (Contacts with signal:hot) | Increase follow-up cadence or improve CTA clarity |
| **Time to Follow-up** | last_signal_date → actual contact follow-up | Set SLA: contact hot lead within 4 hours of signal |
| **WhatsApp Response Rate** | Contacts who replied to WA / Contacts contacted via WA | Benchmark >40% for MENA; test message variants |
| **Signal Score Decay** | Track how long signal:hot leads remain uncontacted before downgrade | Automate weekly re-score: hot + no activity >7 days → warm |

### Recommended Automation After This Query
Create an n8n workflow triggered on this result:
```
Trigger: User searched for hot unbooked leads
Action 1: Tag all results with campaign:hot-follow-up (for attribution)
Action 2: Create tasks for team assigned users
Action 3: Send Slack alert to #sales with follow-up count
Action 4: Queue WhatsApp outreach (rate-limited, MENA-aware timing)
```

## 8. CRITICAL EDGE CASES & HANDLING

### Edge Case 1: Contact Has Both signal:hot + status:meeting_booked
```
Scenario: Contact tagged signal:hot but also has status:meeting_booked
Action: EXCLUDE from follow-up list (meeting already confirmed)
Reason: User asked for those "without meeting booked"
Check: is 'status:meeting_booked' in contact.tags?
```

### Edge Case 2: Contact Has meeting_date Populated But No status:meeting_booked Tag
```
Scenario: meeting_date field has a value, but tag is missing
Action: EXCLUDE (meeting exists even if tag is out of sync)
Reason: meeting_date is source of truth; tag is automation marker
Check: contact.customFields.meeting_date != ""?
```

### Edge Case 3: signal:hot Contact with signal_score < 7
```
Scenario: Contact tagged signal:hot but signal_score custom field shows 5
Action: FLAG in results note ("score mismatch — re-score needed")
Reason: Tag and custom field are out of sync; needs audit
Flag: Add note: "Signal score (5) doesn't match hot tag; re-evaluate"
```

### Edge Case 4: No Results (Zero signal:hot Contacts)
```
Scenario: MCP returns empty contacts array
Action: Report to user clearly
Response: "No contacts currently tagged signal:hot. Check:
          1. Are hot leads being tagged properly by n8n?
          2. Have all signal:hot leads been moved to meetings?"

Diagnostic: Recommend Mode D (Analytics) to check pipeline health
```

### Edge Case 5: Results Exceed 100 (Pagination)
```
Scenario: >100 signal:hot contacts exist
Action: Implement pagination loop
Code:
  page = 1
  all_results = []
  while true:
    response = search_contacts(query="signal:hot", limit=100, page=page)
    all_results.extend(response.contacts)
    if not response.hasMore:
      break
    page += 1
```
