# SMOrch GTM Engine

**Signal-to-Trust GTM Engine** — autonomous campaign management for MENA and global B2B markets.

Built by [SMOrchestra.ai](https://smorchestra.ai) | Mamoun Alamouri

## What This Plugin Does

Takes a campaign brief, runs the Signal-to-Trust methodology with trust engineering and psychological trigger mapping, produces precision outreach assets per campaign, deploys across email, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and social, monitors metrics, and generates weekly optimization recommendations.

The core thesis: relationship-based selling is a tax on growth. Signal-based trust engineering is the replacement. This plugin operationalizes that thesis into a repeatable campaign machine.

## Quick Start

1. Install the plugin in Cowork
2. Connect MCP servers (see CONNECTORS.md) — optional but recommended for deployment
3. Run `/launch-campaign` with your BRD or answer the questionnaire
4. Review the generated assets (vulnerability arc emails, LinkedIn DMs + authority posts, social, VSL scripts, branded DOCX/PDF/PPTX)
5. Run `/deploy-campaign` to push to all platforms
6. Run `/weekly-review` every Monday for optimization

## Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/launch-campaign [brd]` | Full campaign from BRD — runs entire skill chain, produces complete asset bundle |
| `/weekly-review` | Cross-platform performance review + optimization recommendations |
| `/detect-signals [icp]` | Signal detection and ICP validation with Trust/Intent classification |
| `/generate-assets [campaign] [week]` | Generate weekly assets from wedges — emails, LinkedIn, social, VSL |
| `/deploy-campaign [campaign]` | Multi-platform deployment to Instantly + HeyReach + GHL |
| `/campaign-dashboard [campaign]` | Cross-platform metrics dashboard with funnel visualization |
| `/research-prospect [name]` | Deep signal-based prospect research with wedge recommendation |
| `/wedge [signal]` | Quick wedge from a signal — 3 variants + outreach sequence |
| `/campaign-guide` | Walk through all 9 phases of a B2B Signal Sales campaign |

## Signal-to-Trust Framework

The plugin implements the complete Signal-to-Trust GTM methodology:

**Quarterly → Monthly → Weekly → Daily** campaign hierarchy where each level derives from the one above (domino validation).

**Trust Engineering Thesis:** MENA isn't a relationship market. It's a trust market. Trust is engineerable. Every asset activates psychological triggers in a deliberate sequence, not random feature messaging.

**7 Psychological Positioning Triggers** (priority order):
1. Identity Threat (PRIMARY) — "Your competitors already have this"
2. Costly Signal (PRIMARY) — Proof that can't be faked
3. Temporal Window (PRIMARY) — "This window closes"
4. Asymmetric Information — "You don't know what you don't know"
5. In-Group/Out-Group — "The operators who get it vs. those who don't"
6. Transformation Narrative — Before/after system proof
7. Cognitive Fluency — Simple frameworks that stick

**Hard Stop Rules:**
1. Fit=Fail → STOP (no outreach regardless of signal strength)
2. Signal > 90 days → STOP (stale signals produce bad outreach)
3. Wedge must pass one-sentence test
4. Intent signals > Trust signals in sequence order

**3-Email Vulnerability Arc** (replaces 6-email volume approach):
- E1 (Day 1): Origin Story — why you built this, personal vulnerability
- E2 (Day 3): Trust-as-Science Confession — the "Still is" pattern
- E3 (Day 6): System Proof — specific numbers, binary CTA

**Silence Types** (why prospects aren't responding):
- Proof Silence — they don't believe you can deliver
- Cost Silence — they think it's too expensive
- Trust Silence — they don't trust you yet
- Timing Silence — it's not the right time
- Clarity Silence — they don't understand what you do
