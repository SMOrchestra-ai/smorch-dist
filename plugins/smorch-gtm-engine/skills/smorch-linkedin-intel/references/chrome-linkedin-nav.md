## Element Finding Strategies

### Finding Key Profile Elements
- **Name**: Usually the first heading element on profile page
- **Title/Headline**: Second heading or first description element
- **About section**: Look for "About" heading, content follows
- **Experience**: Look for "Experience" heading, list items follow
- **Activity**: Look for "Activity" link or "Show all activity" button
- **Connection degree**: Usually near the name, shows "1st", "2nd", "3rd"
- **Mutual connections**: Link showing "X mutual connections"

### Finding Post Elements
- **Post text**: Main content block within feed items
- **Author**: Name link at top of each post card
- **Date**: Relative time stamp (e.g., "2d", "1w") near author name
- **Engagement count**: Likes/reactions count below post
- **Comments count**: Comment icon with count
- **"see more" button**: Expands truncated post text

### Finding Company Elements
- **Company name**: Main heading on company page
- **Employee count**: Usually in overview section
- **Industry**: In company details
- **Posts tab**: Tab navigation on company page
- **People tab**: Tab navigation on company page

## Error Handling

### "Profile not available"
- Profile may be private or outside your network
- Note as "limited access" in research output
- Try company page instead for indirect intel

### "Content not available" on activity feed
- Some profiles hide their activity
- Try searching for their name in content search instead
- Check if they have a "Creator" badge (creators' content is always visible)

### Login redirect / session expired
- Stop immediately
- Alert user to log in manually
- Never attempt credential entry

### Rate limiting indicators
- Slow page loads (>10 seconds)
- "Something went wrong" errors
- CAPTCHA or verification prompts
- Repeated redirects to login page

Response: Stop session, wait 15+ minutes, reduce remaining scope

## Data Extraction Tips

### Profile Language Detection
LinkedIn doesn't always explicitly show profile language. Detect by:
- Language of headline/title
- Language of About section
- Language of recent posts
- URL locale prefix (rarely reliable)

### Connection Degree Importance
- 1st degree: Can message directly, highest trust baseline
- 2nd degree: Mutual connections visible, warm path available
- 3rd degree: Limited visibility, may need InMail or email
- "Out of network": Very limited, search only via Sales Navigator

### Screenshot Best Practices
- Use `screenshot` action to capture evidence of signals
- Screenshot profile headers for record keeping
- Screenshot relevant posts before they disappear
- Name screenshots: `[name]-[type]-[date].png`
- Store in session directory for reference

## Session Logging
After each LinkedIn browsing session:
```
Session: [date] [start-end time]
Profiles researched: [count]
Content analyzed: [count of posts]
Signals found: [count and types]
Issues: [any UI changes, errors, rate limits]
Time per profile: [average minutes]
```
