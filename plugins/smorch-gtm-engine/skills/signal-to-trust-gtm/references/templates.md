## Period: [Date range]

## Metrics Summary
| Metric | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Trend |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Reply Rate | X% | X% | X% | up/down/flat |
| Meeting Rate | X% | X% | X% | up/down/flat |

- **Wedge 2**: [Reply X%, Meeting X%] <-- **WINNER**
- **Wedge 3**: [Reply X%, Meeting X%]

## Pattern Discovery
**New signals observed**:
1. "[8 responders mentioned 'sales team scattered']" -> Potential new Intent signal
2. "[5 prospects asked about geographic coverage]" -> Potential Friction silence

## Recommendations
### Option A: Double Down (Recommended)
- **Action**: Continue Wedge 2, create A/B variants
- **Rationale**: 13.7% reply rate is 2.1x benchmark
- **Assets needed**: 2 new email variants

### Option B: Pivot to New Signal
- **Action**: Test "geographic distribution" signal
- **New wedge**: "[One-sentence wedge for new signal]"
- **Risk**: Restart momentum

### Option C: Hybrid
- **Action**: 70% Wedge 2, 30% new signal test
- **Rationale**: Maintain performance while exploring

## Template Evolution
**Winning patterns**:
- Subject lines with "[specific data point]" -> 1.8x open rate
- P.S. with "[micro-commitment]" -> 2.3x reply rate

## Wedge Sentence Templates by ICP

**Template**: "[Observed Signal] is costing you [Specific Outcome]. Here's the [One-Line Solution]."

**Examples by ICP:**
- MENA SaaS: "Your Instagram followers are generating $79 per 1000. Owned contacts generate $582. That's 8x ROI you're leaving on the table."
- Real Estate Brokers: "Responding after 30 minutes costs you 21x in conversion. The first 5 minutes is everything."
- Beauty Clinics: "98% of your leads say 'I'll think about it.' 80% will book after 5-12 touchpoints. You're missing the backend 50x improvement."

## Culture Map Adaptation Reference

### MENA Adaptation (Trust-first):
- High-context (implied vs explicit)
- Relationship-before-task
- Indirect negative feedback
- Longer trust-building sequences

### US Adaptation (Intent-first):
- Low-context (explicit, direct)
- Task-before-relationship
- Direct communication
- Shorter, data-driven sequences

### Germany Adaptation (Data-first):
- Extremely low-context (hyper-explicit)
- Structured, formal
- Principle-based reasoning
- Longer, evidence-heavy sequences

### Example 3: Performance Analysis & Pivot

**User**: "Analyze last week's performance and recommend pivot"

**Meta Skill Execution**:

1. **Calls performance-analyzer**:
   - Loads: Reply rates, meeting rates, objection keywords, winning templates
   - Analysis:
     - Overall reply rate: 9.1% (1.5x benchmark)
     - Meeting rate: 1.2% (1.5x benchmark)
     - Wedge 2 still winning (14.3% reply)
     - **New pattern**: 8 responders mentioned "sales team scattered across regions"

2. **Calls campaign-strategist**:
   - Evaluates: New signal = "Geographic distribution" (Intent signal)
   - Options:
     - A) Double down on Wedge 2 (safe, proven)
     - B) Pivot to "Geographic distribution" signal (new opportunity)
     - C) Hybrid: 70% Wedge 2, 30% new signal test

3. **Calls wedge-generator** (for Option B):
   - New wedge: "Your sales team is scattered across Dubai, Riyadh, and Cairo. Your CRM isn't. Regional dashboards are the missing piece."

```
Performance Analysis: MENA SaaS Campaign (Weeks 1-3)

Strong Performance:
   - Reply rate: 9.1% (1.5x benchmark)
   - Meeting rate: 1.2% (1.5x benchmark)
   - Wedge 2 remains winner (14.3% reply)

New Signal Discovered:
   "8 responders mentioned 'sales team scattered across regions'"
   -> Potential Intent signal: Geographic distribution pain

Recommendations:

**Option A: Double Down (Recommended)**
   - Continue Wedge 2, create 2 new A/B variants
   - Rationale: 14.3% reply is exceptional, don't break what's working
   - Risk: LOW

**Option B: Pivot to New Signal**
   - New wedge: "Regional sales teams need regional dashboards"
   - Rationale: Strong signal (8 mentions), specific pain
   - Risk: MEDIUM (restart momentum)

**Option C: Hybrid (70/30 Split)**
   - 70% continue Wedge 2
   - 30% test new "geographic distribution" wedge
   - Rationale: Maintain performance while exploring
   - Risk: LOW-MEDIUM

Which option should I execute?
