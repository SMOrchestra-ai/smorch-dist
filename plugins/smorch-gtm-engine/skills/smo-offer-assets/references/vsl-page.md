# VSL Landing Page Structure

This is the reference for VSL-style (Video Sales Letter) landing pages, modeled on `smorchestra-home-ghl.html`.

The VSL page is **centered and video-focused** — the hero pulls the visitor into a video that does the heavy selling, supported by structured offer cards and proof sections below.

## Section Map (Top to Bottom)

### 1. Fixed Navigation
- Dark bg with blur backdrop
- Logo left, links center, CTA button right
- Mobile hamburger menu

### 2. Hero Section (Dark BG — centered)
```
[Subtitle text — 1 line, muted]
[H1 — 2-3 lines, with .sm-accent span on key phrase]
[Subtext — 1-2 lines explaining the offer]
[Video Container — 16:9 aspect ratio with play button overlay]
[3-Card Grid below video — offer cards with top accent border]
```

**Key details:**
- Everything is **centered** (text-align: center on the hero)
- The video container has a dark background with a play button SVG overlay
- Clicking play replaces the placeholder with an iframe embed (YouTube/Vimeo/Wistia)
- The 3 cards below the video represent the 3 core offers or pillars
- Each card has: orange top border, icon, title, short description, optional "Learn More" link
- One card can use `.outline` variant (orange border all around instead of just top)

**Hero CSS pattern:**
```css
.sm-hero {
  padding: 140px 0 80px;
  text-align: center;
  position: relative;
}
.sm-hero h1 {
  font-size: 56px;
  font-weight: 800;
  line-height: 1.1;
  margin-bottom: 24px;
  max-width: 900px;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
.sm-video-container {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 48px auto;
  border-radius: 12px;
  overflow: hidden;
  aspect-ratio: 16/9;
  background: #0A0A0A;

  cursor: pointer;
  position: relative;
}
```
