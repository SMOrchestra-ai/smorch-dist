# Perfect Webinar Engine v2

You're about to build a **scored, production-ready webinar** using Russell Brunson's Perfect Webinar framework, enhanced with Mamoun's Signal-to-Trust extensions. This skill walks you through dimension-based intake, then produces:
- 23-slide PPTX deck with full speaker scripts in notes (via PptxGenJS)
- Campaign assets (5 social posts, 3-email sequence, 2 LinkedIn DMs)
- Stories master document (Epiphany Bridge format)
- VSL-style registration landing page

Every output is scored against a 10-dimension rubric before delivery.

---

## PHASE 0: DIMENSION-BASED INTAKE

Before producing anything, gather information organized by the 10 scoring dimensions. These questions are NOT optional. Weak answers produce weak decks. Push back on vague responses.

### DIMENSION 1: Teaching vs Selling Balance (CRITICAL - changes structure)

This is the FIRST question because it fundamentally changes the deck architecture.

1. **Event context:** Who is hosting this event? (Your own event, or hosted by a third party like RAKEZ, GITEX, a university, an accelerator?)
2. **Audience expectation:** Are they expecting education with a soft offer, or are they expecting a pitch? (Teaching-heavy = case studies as illustrations, soft CTA. Selling-heavy = proof as persuasion, hard CTA.)
3. **What's the split?** Roughly what % teaching vs selling do you want? (80/20 teaching is for hosted events. 60/40 is for your own webinars. 40/60 is for sales presentations.)

**Why this matters:** A RAKEZ-hosted event where founders expect education needs case studies framed as teaching illustrations, a soft offer, and genuine framework teaching. Your own webinar can be more direct with proof-as-persuasion and a harder CTA. This changes slides 17-22 significantly.

**MODE SELECTION based on answers:**
- **TEACH MODE** (hosted events, 70-80% teaching): Case studies as teaching illustrations, soft offer, Session 1 Guarantee framing, no urgency pressure
- **SELL MODE** (your own events, 50-60% teaching): Proof-as-persuasion, stack reveal, urgency mechanics, scarcity
- **HYBRID MODE** (partner events, 60-70% teaching): Teaching with embedded proof, medium CTA, social proof urgency

### DIMENSION 2: Big Promise Spine

The Big Promise is the macro frame that holds the entire presentation together. Without it, the 3 secrets float without a spine.

4. **The ONE outcome:** What is the ONE thing your audience will be able to do/believe/understand after this talk? (Not "learn about sales" but "stop losing deals to silence")
5. **The 3 "withouts":** What are three things your audience currently believes they NEED to do that you'll show them they DON'T need?
   - Without #1 should map to Myth #1 (Vehicle - the method they think works)
   - Without #2 should map to Myth #2 (Internal - the skill/trait they think they need)
   - Without #3 should map to Myth #3 (External - the market condition they think is required)

**Formula:** "By the end of this session, I'll show you how to [OUTCOME], without [Without #1], without [Without #2], without [Without #3]."

**Quality gate:** If the 3 withouts don't map 1:1 to 3 myths, STOP. The architecture is broken. Fix this before proceeding.

### DIMENSION 3: Myth-to-Secret Architecture

Each myth is a false belief your audience holds. Each secret breaks one myth and reveals a named framework.

6. **Myth #1 (Vehicle - the METHOD they think works):**
   - What method do they currently believe is the right approach?
   - What is the TRUTH (Secret #1)?
   - What named framework proves the secret? (Must have a name, e.g., "The Pre-Meeting Kill Sheet")
7. **Myth #2 (Internal - the SKILL/TRAIT they think they need):**
   - What do they believe about themselves that limits them?
   - What is the TRUTH (Secret #2)?
   - What named framework proves it?
8. **Myth #3 (External - the MARKET CONDITION they think is required):**
   - What do they believe about the market/world that holds them back?
   - What is the TRUTH (Secret #3)?
   - What named framework proves it?

**Quality gate:** Each myth MUST have: (a) a named myth, (b) a contrarian secret that directly counters it, (c) a named framework reveal. No exceptions.

### DIMENSION 4: Emotional Arc

9. **The hook:** What is the opening pattern interrupt? (Silence? Provocative question? Shocking stat? Physical demonstration?)
10. **The tension points:** What are 2-3 moments where the audience should feel uncomfortable or challenged? (Example: "The Kuwaiti Lunch story where I realized my best technique was my biggest enemy")
11. **The release moments:** Where do you want the audience to feel relief, validation, or hope? (Example: "The case study reveal showing $13M combined revenue")

### DIMENSION 5: 4 Silent Killers (Buyer Objection Framework)

These are the 4 questions every buyer silently asks. Your presentation and offer must address ALL 4.

12. **Silent Killer #1 - Choice Overload:** "Is this confusing? Are there too many options?" How does your presentation simplify the decision?
13. **Silent Killer #2 - Expectations Gap:** "Have you done this before with someone like me?" What proof shows you've solved this for people like them?
14. **Silent Killer #3 - Information Overload:** "Will this work in MY specific situation?" How do you show market-specific relevance?
15. **Silent Killer #4 - Valuation Problem:** "Is this worth my time/money?" How does your offer deliver obvious ROI?

### DIMENSION 6: Proof Architecture

16. **How many case studies/proof points?** (Minimum 2, ideal 3)
17. **For each case study, provide:**
    - Company/person name (or anonymized descriptor)
    - BEFORE state (what was broken, what they believed)
    - AFTER state (what changed, specific results with numbers)
    - Which Silent Killer(s) this case study addresses
    - Which myth this case study illustrates
18. **Combined proof number:** What is the aggregate result across all case studies? (e.g., "$13M in combined new revenue")
19. **Proof mode:** Are these framed as teaching illustrations (TEACH MODE) or persuasion proof (SELL MODE)?

### DIMENSION 7: The Offer

20. **What are you offering?** (Free audit, paid cohort, consulting engagement, course, mastermind, etc.)
21. **Stack items:** List every component of your offer (minimum 3, maximum 7)
22. **For each stack item, which myth does it resolve?** (This is the Offer-to-Secret linkage)
23. **Guarantee or risk reversal:** What de-risks the decision? (Session 1 guarantee, money-back, free trial, etc.)
24. **Scarcity/exclusivity:** Is there a genuine limit? (Cohort size, deadline, founding member pricing)
25. **Qualifying criteria:** Who is this NOT for? (This actually increases trust)

### DIMENSION 8: Offer-to-Secret Linkage

This is verified during Phase 2 (deck build), but you should think about it now:

26. **Map each stack item to a specific myth it resolves:**
    - Stack item 1 fixes Myth ___
    - Stack item 2 fixes Myth ___
    - Stack item 3 fixes Myth ___
    - (etc.)

**Quality gate:** Every myth must have at least one stack item that resolves it. If a myth has no corresponding stack item, the offer architecture is broken.

### DIMENSION 9: MENA Contextualization

27. **Is this for a MENA audience?** If yes:
    - Which Gulf markets? (UAE, KSA, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman)
    - What cultural trust dynamics apply? (Erin Meyer's 3 trust systems: task-based, relationship-based, consensus-based)
    - What MENA-specific stories or references will you use?
    - Language: English, Arabic, or bilingual?
28. **If NOT MENA:** What market-specific context needs to be woven in? (Every market has its version of "the coffee meeting myth")

### DIMENSION 10: Stories

29. **Origin Story:** Your personal transformation (Epiphany Bridge: Setup - Fall - Dark Night - Epiphany - New Belief)
    - One specific moment. Not "throughout my career." One scene.
    - Where were you? What happened? What did you realize?
30. **Story 1 (proves Secret 1):** A specific moment showing the vehicle myth is wrong
31. **Story 2 (proves Secret 2):** A specific moment showing someone like them CAN do this
32. **Story 3 (proves Secret 3):** A specific moment showing the market has changed

**Quality gate:** Each story must break exactly ONE myth. If a story tries to prove multiple things, it's too diluted.

### EVENT LOGISTICS (gathered last, not first)

33. **Event name, date, time, location**
34. **Audience size and type**
35. **Event duration** (presentation time, not including Q&A)
36. **Registration link** (if it exists)
37. **Speaker name, title, company, key credential**
38. **Campaign timeline** (how many days before event do posts/emails start?)

---

## PHASE 1: ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION

Before building anything, validate the architecture:

1. **Big Promise test:** Read the Big Promise aloud. Does it create desire AND curiosity?
2. **Without-to-Myth mapping:** Do the 3 "withouts" map 1:1 to the 3 myths?
3. **Myth-to-Secret mapping:** Does each secret directly counter its myth?
4. **Secret-to-Framework mapping:** Does each secret have a named framework?
5. **Story-to-Myth mapping:** Does each story break exactly one myth?
6. **Offer-to-Secret mapping:** Does each stack item link to a specific myth?
7. **Silent Killers coverage:** Does the offer address all 4 Silent Killers?
8. **Hormozi Value Equation check:** Dream Outcome (high) x Perceived Likelihood (high) / Time Delay (low) x Effort (low)

**Score the architecture on the 10-dimension rubric (see Phase 6) BEFORE building.** If any dimension scores below 7, fix it before proceeding.

Present the architecture to the user as a summary table and get approval before building.

---

## PHASE 2: STORIES

Read `references/story-architecture.md` for Epiphany Bridge framework.

Take raw story inputs and structure them:
- **Epiphany Bridge format:** Setup - Fall - Dark Night - Epiphany - New Belief
- **"One Specific Moment" principle:** every story anchors on a single scene
- **Full vs. Compressed versions:**
  - Full: for VSL, YouTube, long-form (3-5 minutes)
  - Compressed: for the deck (90-120 seconds, full emotional arc)
- **Myth mapping:** Each story explicitly tagged with which myth it breaks

**Output:** `[event-name]-stories.md`

---

## PHASE 3: DECK (23 Slides)

Read `references/deck-structure.md` for the exact slide-by-slide structure.

Building a 23-slide deck with:
- **Design system:** Dark navy/orange (battle-tested from RAKEZ V6)
  - Background: #0D0D1A (near-black navy)
  - Card: #161625 (slightly lighter)
  - Accent: #E8651A (orange)
  - Text: #FFFFFF / #CCCCCC / #888899
- **Every slide includes detailed speaker notes/scripts:**
  - Exact words to say (in quotes)
  - Timing (seconds per slide)
  - Stage directions (move, pause, eye contact, voice volume)
  - Pause instructions (with duration and what to do during pause)
  - Transition cues to next slide
- **PptxGenJS build script** generated and executed
- **Icon rendering** via react-icons + sharp (ALWAYS prefix color with # for react-icons)

### 23-Slide Architecture

**OPENING (Slides 1-5):**
1. Title + Authority (event branding + speaker credentials)
2. Hook Question (pattern interrupt + silence beat)
3. Silence Payoff + Big Domino (reframe the problem, "engineerable" revelation)
4. **THE BIG PROMISE** (the most important slide: outcome + 3 withouts + "Three myths are keeping you stuck")
5. Accusation Audit (acknowledge skepticism, build trust through honesty)

**ORIGIN + FOUNDATION (Slides 6-8):**
6. Origin Story (Epiphany Bridge with visual timeline)
7. 4 Silent Killers (the buyer's 4 silent questions, in relatable format)
8. The Big Shift (research backing, e.g., JOLT: 60% lost to indecision)

**THREE SECRETS (Slides 9-15):**
9. MYTH #1 - SECRET #1 (Vehicle: method myth broken + story + framework tease)
10. MYTH #2 - SECRET #2 (Internal: skill/trait myth broken + story + framework)
11. Trust/Research Visual (supporting research for Secret #2, e.g., Trust Equation 2x2)
12. MYTH #3 - SECRET #3 (External: market myth broken + story + framework)
13. Cultural/Market Visual (supporting research for Secret #3, e.g., Erin Meyer Trust Map)
14. The System Tease (named system overview, 3 components, tease not teach)
15. 3 Belief Shifts Summary (From/To for each myth, visual cards)

**PROOF (Slides 16-21):**
16. Cost of Inaction (what they lose by NOT changing, 4 stat callouts)
17. "Does it work?" transition (pattern interrupt before proof)
18. Case Study 1 (BEFORE/AFTER + which Silent Killers addressed)
19. Case Study 2 (BEFORE/AFTER + which Silent Killers addressed)
20. Case Study 3 (BEFORE/AFTER + which Silent Killers addressed)
21. Combined Proof ($XM combined revenue, black background, let number land)

**OFFER + CLOSE (Slides 22-23):**
22. The Offer (stack items linked to myths, logistics, guarantee, qualifying criteria)
23. Close (contrarian thesis + contact info + final emotional beat)

**MODE VARIATIONS:**
- **TEACH MODE:** Slides 16-20 are "teaching illustrations." Slide 22 is soft ("If you want to go deeper..."). No urgency pressure.
- **SELL MODE:** Slides 16-20 are "proof of results." Slide 22 is stack reveal with urgency. Scarcity mechanics on slide 22.
- **HYBRID MODE:** Slides 16-20 are "teaching illustrations with results." Slide 22 is medium offer with social proof.

**Output:** `[event-name]-deck.pptx` (generated via PptxGenJS)

## PHASE 4: CAMPAIGN ASSETS

Read `references/social-templates.md` and `references/email-templates.md`.

### Social Posts (5 LinkedIn posts)
1. Big Promise Post (3-5 days before)
2. Secret 1 Post / Myth Bust (2-3 days before)
3. Secret 2 Post / Research angle (1-2 days before)
4. Secret 3 Post / Contrarian thesis (day before or day of)
5. Post-Event FOMO Post (after event, "DM me SYSTEM" mechanic)

### Email Sequence (3 emails)
1. Registration Push (3-5 days before, story-led)
2. Urgency / Last Call (day before, stat-led)
3. Post-Webinar (same day, recap + offer)

### LinkedIn DMs (2 versions)
1. Warm Connection (known contacts, reference shared context)
2. Cold Connection (ICP strangers, signal-based personalization)

**Output:** `[event-name]-campaign-assets.md`

---

## PHASE 5: VSL LANDING PAGE

Read `references/landing-page-structure.md`.

Single HTML file with:
- Hero: Event name, date, speaker credentials
- 3 "What You'll Learn" cards (one per secret, teased not taught)
- Speaker bio, authority sources
- Registration CTA with countdown timer
- SMO dark design system (black bg, orange accent)
- Mobile responsive

**Output:** `[event-name]-registration-page.html`

---

## PHASE 6: SCORING & QA

Score the deck against the 10-dimension rubric. Each dimension 0-10.

### The 10-Dimension Rubric

| # | Dimension | What to Score | Target |
|---|-----------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Big Promise Spine | Clear promise? 3 withouts map to 3 myths? Offer ladders back? | 9+ |
| 2 | Myth-to-Secret Architecture | 3 myths clearly stated and broken? Epiphany Bridge stories for each? | 9+ |
| 3 | Emotional Arc | Hook-Story-Offer flow? Tension/release moments? Energy builds toward offer? | 8+ |
| 4 | 4 Silent Killers Integration | All 4 addressed? Case studies map back? Offer addresses all 4? | 8+ |
| 5 | Teaching vs Selling Balance | Matches the mode (Teach/Sell/Hybrid)? Tone consistent? Offer fits context? | 8+ |
| 6 | Speaker Script Quality | ALL slides have notes? Natural delivery? Timing, pauses, stage directions? | 9+ |
| 7 | Visual Design | Dark premium aesthetic? Consistent palette? Icons/shapes? No clutter? | 8+ |
| 8 | Proof Architecture | Case studies framed correctly for mode? Before/after? Silent Killer mapping? | 8+ |
| 9 | Offer-to-Secret Linkage | Each stack item links to a myth? "System that fixes what you learned" framing? Guarantee? | 9+ |
| 10 | MENA Contextualization | Market-specific references? Cultural trust dynamics? Local stories? Language appropriate? | 8+ |

**Scoring process:**
1. Convert deck to PDF via LibreOffice
2. Extract slide images via pdftoppm
3. Run visual QA (fresh eyes inspection of every slide)
4. Fix any issues (text clipping, low contrast icons, footer overlap, element collision)
5. Re-render and verify fixes
6. Score against rubric
7. Present score table to user with justification per dimension

**Target: 8.5+ weighted average.** If below 8.0, identify weakest dimensions and fix before delivery.

---

## PHASE 7: DELIVERY

Present all deliverables with file links:
- Deck (.pptx)
- Stories (.md)
- Campaign assets (.md)
- Landing page (.html)
- Score card (in conversation)

Brief summary. No excessive post-amble.

---

## OUTPUT FILE NAMING

All files follow this pattern:
- `[event-name]-deck.pptx`
- `[event-name]-stories.md`
- `[event-name]-campaign-assets.md`
- `[event-name]-registration-page.html`

Example: `rakez-signal-sales-2026-deck.pptx`

---

## REFERENCE FILES

Read these before starting each phase:
- `references/perfect-webinar-framework.md` - Framework + Big Promise formula + Silent Killers + scoring rubric
- `references/story-architecture.md` - Epiphany Bridge structure + myth-story mapping
- `references/deck-structure.md` - 23-slide breakdown + design system + PptxGenJS patterns
- `references/social-templates.md` - Post structures
- `references/email-templates.md` - Email + DM structures
- `references/landing-page-structure.md` - Page layout + HTML patterns

---

## HARD STOP RULES

These kill the webinar. Check before every phase:

1. **No Big Promise = no deck.** If the Big Promise isn't crystal clear with 3 withouts mapped to 3 myths, STOP.
2. **No named framework per secret = broken architecture.** Every secret MUST have a named framework reveal.
3. **No story per myth = no emotional proof.** Each myth needs an Epiphany Bridge story.
4. **No offer-to-secret linkage = disconnected stack.** Every stack item must link to a myth.
5. **Mode mismatch = audience trust broken.** Teaching event with hard sell = disaster. Sales event with no CTA = wasted opportunity.
6. **No speaker scripts = unprepared speaker.** Every slide needs exact dialogue, timing, pauses.
7. **Icons rendered without # prefix = black icons on dark background.** ALWAYS prefix colors with # for react-icons rendering.

---

## PptxGenJS TECHNICAL NOTES (from V6 battle-testing)

- Use `mkShadow()` factory function (fresh object each call) to avoid PptxGenJS shadow mutation bug
- Icon rendering: `iconPng(Component, "#E8651A")` - MUST include # prefix
- Speaker notes: `slide.addNotes(string)` - use backtick template literals for multi-line
- Slide layout: `pres.layout = "LAYOUT_16x9"`
- Footer helper: position at x:5.5, w:3.5 to avoid collision with slide number at x:9.3
- Slide numbers: position at x:9.3, y:5.15
- For black background slides (combined proof), use separate text elements instead of one large text array to avoid bottom text clipping
- LibreOffice PDF conversion may show `malloc_consolidate` warning - this is cosmetic, PDF is created successfully

---

## START

Gather answers to the dimension-based intake questions above. Start with Dimension 1 (Teaching vs Selling Balance) because it changes everything downstream. Push back on vague answers. Score the architecture before building.
