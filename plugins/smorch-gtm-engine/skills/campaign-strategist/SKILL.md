# Campaign Strategist

## Purpose

This sub-skill handles the **strategic alignment** of the complete campaign hierarchy: **Quarterly → Monthly → Weekly → Daily**. It ensures the "domino effect" where each level derives from and amplifies the level above it.

**Core Philosophy**: Compounding impact through hierarchical alignment. Every level narrows from the one above. Every asset activates psychological triggers mapped at the strategy level. Trust engineering thesis runs through everything.

---

## When to Call This Skill

The meta skill `signal-to-trust-gtm` calls this sub-skill during:
- **Mode A (New Campaign)**: First sub-skill called after questionnaire
- **Mode C (Performance Analysis)**: When evaluating pivot options

Directly invoke when user asks:
- "Create campaign strategy for [ICP]"
- "Align my quarterly theme to monthly wedges"
- "Generate campaign brief for [target]"
- "Plan the campaign hierarchy for [offer]"

---

## Inputs

### Required

1. **ICP** (from Q2 of questionnaire or positioning-engine output)
   - MENA SaaS Founders
   - US Real Estate Brokers
   - MENA Beauty Clinics
   - US eCommerce (DTC)
   - MENA B2B Founders (general: past PMF, broken GTM)
   - Other (custom)

2. **Positioning Document** (from positioning-engine)
   - Core thesis, offer architecture, psychological triggers, mechanism visualization
   - If no positioning-engine output exists, gather: one-liner, ICP, offer, competitive alternatives

3. **Quarterly Feature** (from Q3 of questionnaire)
   - One-sentence outcome-focused positioning
   - Example: "Replace relationship selling with trust engineering in 6 weeks"

4. **Monthly Narrowing Strategy** (from Q4 of questionnaire)
   - A) By ICP segment (vertical focus)
   - B) By feature breakdown (3 sub-wedges)
   - C) By silence type (one silence all month)
   - D) By story arc (vulnerability arc: origin → science → proof)
   - E) Let skill decide based on signal density

5. **Weekly Wedge Strategy** (from Q6 of questionnaire)
   - A) Different angles on same monthly wedge (default)
   - B) Sequential story (Week 1→2→3 builds narrative)
   - C) A/B/C test variants (same core, different psychology)
   - D) Vulnerability arc (mirrors email sequence: failure → confession → proof)

### Optional
- **Existing campaign context** (if continuing from previous month)
- **Signal data** (to inform monthly narrowing if strategy = E)
- **Performance metrics** (if Mode C pivot evaluation)
- **Brand template/colors** (if not using SMOrch defaults)

## Alignment Logic

### Quarterly → Monthly (The Narrowing)

**Strategy A: By ICP Segment**
```
Quarterly: "Replace relationship selling with trust engineering"
  ↓
Monthly: "Trust Engineering for MENA SaaS Founders past PMF"
  (Narrowed to: specific ICP vertical + stage)
```

**Strategy B: By Feature Breakdown**
```
Quarterly: "Install Revenue OS in 6 weeks"
  ↓
Monthly Options:
  - "GTM Diagnosis" (weeks 1-2 focus)
  - "Trust-Engine Motion Selection" (weeks 3-4 focus)
  - "AI-Operated Implementation" (weeks 5-6 focus)
  (Narrowed to: one phase of the offer)
```

**Strategy C: By Silence Type**
```
Quarterly: "Compress deal cycles from months to weeks"
  ↓
Monthly: "Proof Silence: They don't believe trust can be engineered"
  (Narrowed to: one of 7 silence types)
```

**Strategy D: By Story Arc (Vulnerability Arc)**
```
Quarterly: "Trust is engineerable. Your coffee meetings are not"
  ↓
Monthly: 3-week vulnerability arc
  - Week 1: Origin story (failure, study, discovery)
  - Week 2: Trust-as-science confession (weakness became edge)
  - Week 3: System proof (AI runs it, here's the evidence)
  (Narrowed to: sequential narrative that mirrors email sequence)
```

**Strategy E: Signal-Driven**
```
Quarterly: "13 trust-engine motions scored to your business"
  ↓
[Analyze signal data]
Monthly: "Signal Sniper Outbound for founders burning cash on SDR teams"
  (Narrowed based on: highest signal density detected)
```

---

### Monthly → Weekly (The Angles)

**Strategy A: Different Angles (Default)**
```
Monthly: "Trust Engineering for MENA SaaS Founders"
  ↓
Week 1: "Your coffee meetings cost 6-12 months per deal" (Identity Threat)
Week 2: "Trust is a science, not a personality trait" (Costly Signal)
Week 3: "AI runs 80% of my GTM. Better." (System Proof)

Each week = different lens on same monthly theme
```

**Strategy B: Sequential Story**
```
Monthly: "Revenue Engineering OS"
  ↓
Week 1: "The failure" (identify problem, build empathy)
Week 2: "The discovery" (amplify insight, build credibility)
Week 3: "The system" (present resolution, build urgency)

Each week = next chapter in narrative arc
```

**Strategy C: A/B/C Variants**
```
Monthly: "Signal-Based Trust Engineering"
  ↓
Week 1: Variant A, B, C (same core, different psychology)
Week 2: Winning variant refined
Week 3: Optimized variant deployed

Each week = iteration on best-performing message
```

**Strategy D: Vulnerability Arc (Recommended for MENA B2B)**
```
Monthly: "Trust is Engineerable"
  ↓
Week 1: Vulnerable Origin (failure → study → cracked it)
  Primary trigger: Identity Threat
Week 2: Confession + Science (weakness became methodology)
  Primary trigger: Identity Threat + Costly Signal
Week 3: System Proof (AI-operated, installed, running)
  Primary trigger: Costly Signal + Temporal Window

Each week = mirrors one email in the 3-email vulnerability arc
All channel assets (email, LinkedIn post, social, DM) align to the week's story beat
```

---

### Weekly → Daily (The Messaging)

Each weekly wedge translates to a coordinated multi-channel push:

| Channel | Structure | Key Rule |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Cold email | 3-email vulnerability arc (Day 1, 3, 6) | One story arc, not 3 pitches |
| LinkedIn DM | Connect clean + single message (A/B test) | No connection note, ever |
| LinkedIn post | Authority post mirroring week's story beat | 55 chars/line, 150-300 words |
| Social post | ICP-targeted, trigger-activated | 150-210 words, copy-paste ready |
| WhatsApp | 3 psychology variants (MENA only) | Warm channel, not cold outreach |

**Tone adaptation** by ICP + geography:
| Market | Context | Language | Trust Mechanism |
|--------|---------|----------|----------------|
| MENA | High (implied, trust-first) | "We", vulnerability, peer references | Confession + costly signal |
| US | Low (explicit, data-first) | "You", metrics, directness | Data + social proof |

---

## ICP-Specific Considerations

### MENA B2B Founders (Past PMF, Broken GTM)

**Quarterly themes that resonate**:
- Trust engineering vs relationship selling (the replacement thesis)
- AI-operated Revenue OS (founder independence)
- 13 trust-engine motions (methodology as differentiator)

**Monthly narrowing preference**: Story arc (vulnerability arc) or by feature breakdown

**Weekly approach**: Vulnerability arc (origin → confession → proof)

**Daily tone**: Vulnerability-first, peer-to-peer operator energy, "we" language, MENA geographic specificity (Dubai, Riyadh, Gulf budget cycles)

**Key triggers**: Identity Threat (coffee meetings = expensive), Costly Signal (91 companies studied, 20 years, 200+ deals), Temporal Window (Q2 budget cycle)

---

### MENA SaaS Founders (Scaling 10-50 Employees)

**Quarterly themes that resonate**:
- Data consolidation (scattered tools pain)
- Regional distribution (Dubai, Riyadh, Cairo teams)
- Trust-building before product demo

**Monthly narrowing preference**: By ICP segment (vertical-specific)

**Weekly approach**: Different angles (high-context communication requires variety)

**Daily tone**: Relationship-first, "we" language, geographic name-dropping

---

### US Real Estate Brokers

**Quarterly themes that resonate**:
- Speed (Golden Window, 5-minute response)
- Lead leakage (backend nurture, follow-up automation)
- Listing capture (open house optimization)

**Monthly narrowing preference**: By silence type (speed-driven, direct)

**Weekly approach**: Sequential story (builds urgency)

**Daily tone**: Task-first, "you" language, data-driven

---

### MENA Beauty Clinics

**Quarterly themes that resonate**:
- Social follower leakage (Instagram → owned contacts)
- Backend nurture (98% say "I'll think about it")
- Response speed (DM → booking conversion)

**Monthly narrowing preference**: By feature breakdown (visual proof emphasis)

**Weekly approach**: Different angles (trust-building requires variety)

**Daily tone**: Visual-first, proof-heavy, WhatsApp-native

---

## Domino Validation

Before outputting campaign brief, validate domino alignment:

### Test 1: Derivation Check
Can Monthly theme be traced back to Quarterly feature? Can each Weekly wedge be traced back to Monthly theme? Both must pass.

### Test 2: Specificity Increase
Is Monthly more specific than Quarterly? Is Weekly more specific than Monthly? Each level must narrow.

### Test 3: Consistency Check
Do all 3 weekly wedges relate to the same monthly theme (different angles) or form a coherent arc (sequential story / vulnerability arc)?

### Test 4: ICP Resonance
Do themes use ICP-specific language and pain points? Would a founder in this geography feel this speaks to their specific reality?

### Test 5: Trigger Alignment
Does each weekly wedge have a clear primary psychological trigger? Do the 3 weeks together cover all 3 primary triggers (Identity Threat, Costly Signal, Temporal Window)?

### Test 6: Trust Engineering Lens
Does the campaign explicitly frame the status quo as expensive/manual/unscalable and the alternative as engineered/systematic/installable? If the campaign reads like generic outbound, it fails this test.

## Integration with Other Sub-Skills

### Downstream Dependencies

After campaign-strategist outputs campaign brief:

1. **signal-detector** uses: ICP, signal type priority, to validate prospects and classify signals
2. **wedge-generator** uses: 3 weekly wedge themes, monthly theme, ICP context, to create one-sentence wedges
3. **asset-factory** uses: wedges, channel mix, ICP + tone, psychological trigger map, brand design system, to produce campaign assets
4. **scoring-orchestrator** uses: all produced assets, to quality-gate before deployment

### Upstream Dependencies

**From positioning-engine**: Core thesis, offer architecture, psychological trigger definitions, mechanism visualization
**From meta skill questionnaire**: Q2 (ICP), Q3 (Quarterly Feature), Q4 (Monthly Narrowing), Q6 (Weekly Strategy)

---

## Error Handling

### Error 1: No Positioning Document
**Symptom**: Campaign requested without positioning-engine output
**Fix**: Run positioning-engine first, or at minimum gather: one-liner thesis, ICP definition, competitive alternatives, offer structure

### Error 2: Quarterly Feature Too Vague
**Symptom**: Feature is generic ("improve sales results")
**Fix**: Prompt user for specific outcome with metric. "Improve sales results" → "Replace relationship selling with trust engineering. Compress deal cycles from 6-12 months to weeks"

### Error 3: Monthly Too Similar to Quarterly
**Symptom**: Monthly = Quarterly (no narrowing occurred)
**Fix**: Force narrowing by applying strategy (ICP segment, feature breakdown, silence type, or story arc)

### Error 4: Weekly Wedges Not Related
**Symptom**: 3 weekly wedges address different problems
**Fix**: Realign all 3 to monthly theme (different angles) or restructure as vulnerability arc (origin → confession → proof)

### Error 5: Missing Trigger Mapping
**Symptom**: Campaign brief has no psychological trigger assignments
**Fix**: Map each weekly wedge to a primary trigger. Ensure all 3 primary triggers appear across the 3 weeks

### Error 6: Generic Tone
**Symptom**: Campaign messaging could come from any consultant
**Fix**: Apply trust engineering lens. Add vulnerability hooks, contrarian claims, specific numbers, named tools. If it sounds like every other outbound agency, rewrite

## Campaign-Strategist → Asset-Factory Handoff

The campaign brief must include enough detail for asset-factory to produce without re-asking:

| Brief Element | Asset-Factory Uses It For |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Trust Engineering thesis alignment | Email vulnerability arc framing |
| Psychological trigger map | Trigger deployment per email/post |
| Weekly wedge themes + story beats | Email subjects, LinkedIn hooks, social angles |
| ICP context + tone | Geographic adaptation, language choices |
| Mechanism visualization | VSL script, landing page, deck system diagram |
| Brand template (or "use default") | DOCX, PDF, PPTX, HTML color/font system |
| Success metrics | Scoring targets, performance benchmarks |

**Output**: Production-ready campaign brief that orchestrates all downstream sub-skills.

Next: Pass campaign brief to signal-detector for prospect validation, then wedge-generator for specific wedges, then asset-factory for production.
