## Reporting Framework

When asked to "analyze," "report on," or "check stats" for GHL/SalesMfast, follow this 6-step framework:

### Step 1: Pull Contact Distribution
Search contacts by tag to understand the current state:
```
mcp__ghl-mcp__search_contacts with tag filters:
- signal:hot → Count active hot leads
- signal:warm → Count nurture pool
- signal:cold → Count dormant leads
- source:instantly → Count email-sourced
- source:heyreach → Count LinkedIn-sourced
- source:website → Count inbound
- source:clay → Count enriched
```

### Step 2: Pull Pipeline Data
```
mcp__ghl-mcp__get_pipelines → List all pipelines and stages
mcp__ghl-mcp__search_opportunities → Get opportunities per pipeline
```

### Step 3: Calculate Conversion Rates
For each pipeline, calculate stage-to-stage conversion:
```
Conversion Rate(Stage A → Stage B) = Count(moved to B) / Count(entered A) × 100
```

### Step 4: Identify Stale Opportunities
Search for opportunities with no activity in:
- Signal Detected: >7 days
- Qualified: >5 days
- Meeting Booked: >2 days past meeting date
- Proposal Sent: >7 days
- Negotiation: >14 days

### Step 5: Channel Distribution
Count contacts by channel availability:
- Has WhatsApp (channel:whatsapp tag)
- Has email only
- Has phone only
- Multi-channel (WhatsApp + email)

### Step 6: Recommendations
Based on the data, provide 3-5 specific action items:
- "Follow up on 12 stale hot leads in the Qualified stage"
- "Re-score 45 cold leads that haven't been touched in 30 days"
- "3 opportunities in MENA SaaS Pipeline have been in Proposal Sent for 10+ days — send WhatsApp follow-up"

## Pipeline Analytics

### Pipeline Velocity
How fast deals move through the pipeline.

```
Velocity = Average days from first stage to Closed Won

Break down by stage:
- New Lead → Signal Detected: Avg X days
- Signal Detected → Qualified: Avg X days
- Qualified → Meeting Booked: Avg X days
- Meeting Booked → Proposal Sent: Avg X days
- Proposal Sent → Negotiation: Avg X days
- Negotiation → Closed Won: Avg X days
Total Pipeline Velocity: X days
```

**Benchmarks:**
| Pipeline | Target Velocity | Alert If > |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| MENA SaaS | 30 days | 45 days |
| US Real Estate | 14 days | 21 days |
| MENA SME | 7 days | 14 days |
| CXMfast | 60 days | 90 days |

### Stage Conversion Rates

**Target conversion rates (outbound-sourced leads):**
```
New Lead → Signal Detected:   30% (most leads never engage)
Signal Detected → Qualified:  40% (signals that qualify)
Qualified → Meeting Booked:   50% (half of qualified get meetings)
Meeting Booked → Proposal:    70% (most meetings lead to proposals)
Proposal → Negotiation:       60% (proposals that generate discussion)
Negotiation → Closed Won:     50% (half of negotiations close)

Overall: 30% × 40% × 50% × 70% × 60% × 50% = 1.26% end-to-end
(This is realistic for outbound — 1 in ~80 new leads becomes a customer)
```

### Weighted Pipeline Value
```python
stage_weights = {
    'New Lead': 0.05,
    'Signal Detected': 0.10,
    'Qualified': 0.20,
    'Meeting Booked': 0.40,
    'Proposal Sent': 0.60,
    'Negotiation': 0.80,
    'Closed Won': 1.00,
    'Closed Lost': 0.00
}

weighted_value = sum(opp.monetary_value * stage_weights[opp.stage]
                     for opp in open_opportunities)
```

## Contact Analytics

### Contact Distribution Report
```
Total contacts: [number]

By Signal Level:
  Hot:  [count] ([%])
  Warm: [count] ([%])
  Cold: [count] ([%])
  None: [count] ([%])

By Source:
  Instantly (cold email): [count] ([%])
  HeyReach (LinkedIn):    [count] ([%])
  Website (inbound):      [count] ([%])
  Clay (enrichment):      [count] ([%])
  Manual:                 [count] ([%])

By ICP:
  MENA SaaS:       [count]
  US Real Estate:  [count]
  MENA SME:        [count]
  Beauty Clinics:  [count]
  CXMfast:         [count]
  Unclassified:    [count]

By Enrichment Status:
  Enriched:  [count] ([%])
  Pending:   [count] ([%])
  Failed:    [count] ([%])
  N/A:       [count] ([%])
```

### Signal Freshness
Contacts with stale signals (last_signal_date > 90 days) should be considered for re-engagement or archival:
```
Fresh signals (<7 days):     [count]
Recent signals (7-30 days):  [count]
Aging signals (30-90 days):  [count]
Stale signals (>90 days):    [count]
No signal data:              [count]
```

### Contact Growth
Track weekly/monthly net new contacts by source to measure top-of-funnel health.

## Signal Attribution

### Source-to-Closed Won Analysis
For each source channel, track the full funnel:

```
Source: Instantly (Cold Email)
  Leads generated:      [count]
  Signals detected:     [count] ([%] signal rate)
  Qualified:            [count] ([%] qualification rate)
  Meetings booked:      [count] ([%] meeting rate)
  Closed Won:           [count] ([%] win rate)
  Revenue attributed:   $[amount]
  Cost per lead:        $[amount] (Instantly subscription / leads)
  CAC:                  $[amount] (total cost / customers acquired)
  ROI:                  [X]x

Source: HeyReach (LinkedIn)
  [same structure]

Source: Website (Inbound)
  [same structure]
```

### Best-Performing ICP
Compare ICPs by win rate and average deal size to focus resources:

```
| ICP | Leads | Won | Win Rate | Avg Deal | Total Revenue |
|-----|-------|-----|----------|----------|---------------|
| MENA SaaS | X | Y | Z% | $A | $B |
| US Real Estate | X | Y | Z% | $A | $B |
