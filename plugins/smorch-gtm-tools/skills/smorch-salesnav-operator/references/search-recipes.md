## Segmentation Rules

If any search returns >2,500 results:
1. First split by geography (country by country)
2. Then split by seniority (VP separate from Director)
3. Then split by industry vertical
4. Never run a search you can't fully review

If a search returns <50 results:
1. Broaden title Boolean (add more synonyms)
2. Remove one signal filter (e.g., drop "Posted in 30 days")
3. Expand geography (add neighboring countries)
4. Check if Profile language filter is too restrictive
