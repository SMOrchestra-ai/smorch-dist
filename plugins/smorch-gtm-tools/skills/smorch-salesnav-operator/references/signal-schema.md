# SignalEvent Schema for Sales Navigator Signals

## Purpose
Normalize every signal extracted from Sales Navigator into a consistent schema that downstream tools (n8n, Supabase, Clay, scoring engine) can consume without per-signal parsing logic.

## SignalEvent Object

```json
{
  "signal_id": "string (UUID, auto-generated)",
  "source": "sales_navigator",
  "detected_at": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "signal_type": "enum (see Signal Type Registry below)",
  "signal_tier": "1 | 2 | 3",

## ICP Fit Qualification Rules

```
PASS (4/4 checks):
  industry_match: Account industry is in target vertical list
  size_match: Account headcount is within ICP range (e.g., 51-2000)
  geo_match: Lead geography is target region (UAE, KSA, Qatar, etc.)
  role_match: Lead title/seniority matches buyer persona

PARTIAL (3/4 checks): Monitor, review next week
FAIL (<3/4 checks): Skip entirely
```

## Priority Scoring

```
P1 = Fit PASS + Tier 1 signal + recency < 7 days
P2 = Fit PASS + Tier 2 signal (any recency)
     OR Fit PASS + Tier 1 signal + recency 8-30 days
P3 = Fit PARTIAL + any signal
     OR Fit PASS + Tier 3 signal
```

## Downstream Routing Format

### To n8n Webhook (JSON POST)
Send the full SignalEvent object. n8n will handle routing based on priority and channel.

### To Clay (for enrichment before outreach)
```
full_name, linkedin_url, company_name, current_title, signal_type, signal_detail.description
```

### To HeyReach (LinkedIn outbound)
```
linkedin_url (with trailing /), first_name, company_name, current_title, signal_type (as tag)
```

### To Instantly (cold email)
```
first_name, last_name, company_name, current_title, email (from Clay enrichment), signal_type (as custom field)
```

### To GHL (CRM)
```
first_name, last_name, email, phone, company_name, current_title, signal_type (as tag), signal_detail.description (as note)
```

## Batch Processing Notes

- Daily triage typically produces 5-20 SignalEvents per session
- Weekly search extraction can produce 50-200 SignalEvents
- Always deduplicate by linkedin_url before sending downstream
- If same lead has multiple signals, create separate SignalEvents but flag in notes
- Dedup window: 30 days (don't re-signal same lead for same signal type within 30 days)
