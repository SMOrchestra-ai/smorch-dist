## Key Metrics & Benchmarks

### Cold Email Benchmarks (Text-Only Outbound)
| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Open Rate | >50% | 30-50% | <30% |
| Reply Rate | >5% | 2-5% | <2% |
| Bounce Rate | <2% | 2-5% | >5% |
| Unsubscribe Rate | <0.5% | 0.5-2% | >2% |
| Opportunities | >1% of sent | 0.5-1% | <0.5% |

### Metric Definitions
```
Open Rate = unique_opened / contacted × 100
Reply Rate = unique_replies / contacted × 100
Bounce Rate = bounced / sent × 100
Unsubscribe Rate = unsubscribed / contacted × 100
Reply-to-Open Ratio = unique_replies / unique_opened × 100
Auto-Reply Rate = unique_replies_automatic / unique_replies × 100
```

**Note on Open Rate:** With tracking disabled (recommended), you won't have open data. In this case, focus on reply rate as the primary metric. Open rate only available if `open_tracking: true`.

### Metric Hierarchy (What Matters Most)
1. **Reply Rate** — Primary metric, measures messaging effectiveness
2. **Bounce Rate** — Data quality indicator, must stay low
3. **Opportunity Rate** — Revenue impact, ultimate success metric
4. **Open Rate** — Only meaningful with tracking enabled (which we usually don't)
5. **Unsubscribe Rate** — Targeting quality indicator

## Performance Analysis Framework

### Step-by-Step Analysis
When asked to analyze campaign performance:

#### Step 1: Pull Data
```
get_campaign_analytics for specific campaign
  OR
get_daily_campaign_analytics for trend data
  OR
get_campaign_analytics (via get_campaign first) for campaign-level overview
```

#### Step 2: Calculate Rates
```
open_rate = unique_opened / contacted
reply_rate = unique_replies / contacted
bounce_rate = (sent - contacted) / sent  [approximate]
auto_reply_pct = unique_replies_automatic / unique_replies
opportunity_rate = unique_opportunities / contacted
```

#### Step 3: Compare Against Benchmarks
Flag any metric in Warning or Critical zone.

#### Step 4: Diagnose Issues
Use the diagnostic decision tree from SKILL.md:

| Low Opens | Low Replies | High Bounces | High Unsubs |
|-----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Deliverability | Messaging | List quality | Targeting |
| Check warmup | Rewrite copy | Stop & clean | Narrow ICP |
| Check tracking | Check personalization | Verify emails | Check relevance |
| Check subject line | Check CTA | Check source | Check frequency |

#### Step 5: Recommend Actions
Always provide specific, prioritized actions:
- P1 (Do now): Issues that will compound if ignored (bounces, deliverability)
- P2 (Do this week): Issues affecting performance (messaging, targeting)
- P3 (Next cycle): Optimizations for next campaign (A/B tests, new angles)

## Cross-Campaign Comparison

### Comparison Framework
When comparing multiple campaigns:

```
1. list_campaigns → get all active campaigns
2. For each campaign: get_campaign_analytics with same date range
3. Build comparison table:

| Campaign | Contacted | Reply Rate | Bounce Rate | Opps | Status |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|------|--------|
| [MENA SaaS] - AI GTM - Feb A | 500 | 7.2% | 1.5% | 12 | ✅ Scale |
| [US RE] - Lead Gen - Feb A | 300 | 2.1% | 4.8% | 2 | ⚠️ Fix |
| [Gulf SME] - WhatsApp - Feb A | 200 | 3.5% | 1.0% | 3 | → Test |

4. Categorize each campaign:
   ✅ SCALE: Reply >5%, bounce <3%, opps >2%
   → TEST: Reply 3-5%, metrics stable, try variants
   ⚠️ FIX: Reply <3% OR bounce >3%, diagnose and fix
   🛑 PAUSE: Bounce >5% OR unsubscribe >2%, stop immediately
```

### Performance Ranking
Rank campaigns by reply rate (primary), then by opportunity rate (secondary):
```
Best performers → Increase daily limits, expand lead lists
Average performers → A/B test variants, refine personalization
Poor performers → Diagnose issue, rewrite or pause
```

### Week-over-Week Trends
Pull daily analytics and calculate rolling 7-day averages:
```
Improving: Week 2 reply rate > Week 1 → Keep running
Flat: Same rates → Consider sequence refresh
Declining: Week 2 < Week 1 → Investigate fatigue, list quality
```
