# Validation Sprint

Rapid validation methodology that combines customer development, lean startups, and audience-first thinking to validate ideas in 14 days or less.

## Core Philosophy

**Don't build, validate. Don't validate, pre-sell. Don't pre-sell, get pre-paid.**

Validation moves through stages of increasing commitment:
1. Conversations (Do they care?)
2. Landing page + email (Will they give their email?)
3. Pre-sell/Waitlist (Will they pay to wait?)
4. Pre-paid (Are they willing to buy NOW?)

Only move to the next stage if the current stage shows signal.

## Framework 1: Steve Blank — Customer Development

### Get Out of the Building (GOOB)

The only truth is outside your office. Everything else is a hypothesis.

**Step 1: Define Your Hypothesis**
- Not: "I want to build a CRM for MENA B2B"
- But: "MENA B2B founders struggle with messy customer data BECAUSE no local CRM exists"
- Better: "If I provide a WhatsApp-integrated CRM, founders will save 5 hours/week"

**Step 2: Find Your Customer (10+ Interviews)**

**Interview Script (30 minutes, max)**

```
Opening (2 min):
"I'm validating an idea and would love 30 min of your time.
Is now a good time? If not, when is?"

Context (3 min):
"I'm exploring if [HYPOTHESIS].
Have you experienced [PROBLEM]?"

Deep Dive (15 min):
- "Tell me about the last time this happened"
- "What's that costing you?" (time, money, frustration)
- "How are you solving this now?" (competitive solution)
- "What would ideal solution look like?" (don't describe your idea yet)
- "Would you use this if it existed?" (test demand)

Solution Reveal (5 min):
- Only NOW describe your idea
- "I'm working on [SOLUTION]. How does that sound?"
- "Would you pay [PRICE] for this?"

Closing (5 min):
- "Who else should I talk to?" (get referrals)
- "Can I follow up once we launch?" (email capture)
```

**MENA-Specific Interview Dynamics:**

- **Relationship first, pitching second:** Start with genuine interest in their business, not your idea
- **WhatsApp > Zoom:** Many founders prefer quick voice message interviews
- **Warm intro > Cold outreach:** Ask for introductions from existing connections
- **Build equity, not just feedback:** "If this works, you get free access for 3 months"

**Interview Signals to Watch For:**

Green flags:
- They spend 20+ minutes talking (passion signal)
- They name specific competitors they use
- They offer to introduce you to others
- They ask pricing questions
- They want early access

Red flags:
- Polite but vague ("That sounds interesting")
- Don't name existing solutions
- Want to think about it / wait for more features
- Don't ask about cost
- Don't volunteer referrals

**Decision Rule:** If 3+ out of 10 show green flags, you have signal. If fewer than 2, pivot hypothesis.

## Framework 2: Eric Ries — Build-Measure-Learn

### The Lean Startup Loop

**HYPOTHESIS → PRODUCT → MEASUREMENT → LEARNING → NEW HYPOTHESIS**

**Step 1: Build (Minimum Viable Product)**

An MVP is NOT a small version of your full product. It's the smallest thing that tests your hypothesis.

MVP examples by stage:

| Hypothesis | MVP |
|-----------|-----|
| "Founders want WhatsApp-native CRM" | WhatsApp bot that logs conversations |
| "Founders will pay $100/mo for GTM coaching" | Landing page + Stripe link, no product yet |
| "Arabic founders prefer bilingual interface" | Bilingual landing page A/B test |
| "3-Day campaign format saves time" | 3-day email sequence, measure open rates |
| "Founders want community over product" | Closed WhatsApp group, 5 invited members |

**Key constraint:** MVP should take 3-7 days to build, not 3 months.

**Step 2: Measure (Actionable Metrics)**

NOT vanity metrics (total signups). ACTIONABLE metrics that predict success.

Actionable metrics for different stages:

| Stage | Metric | Target | Kill Threshold |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Landing page | Email opt-in rate | 10%+ | <3% |
| Pre-sell | Conversion to payment intent | 3%+ | <1% |
| MVP usage | Weekly active users | 30%+ | <10% |
| Retention | Week 2 retention | 40%+ | <20% |
| Growth | Referral rate | 20% of users | <5% |

**MENA-Specific Metrics:**

- **Email open rate:** Expect higher (50%+) due to closer relationships
- **WhatsApp engagement:** 80%+ message open rate (vs 20% email)
- **Conversion rate:** Gulf founders often convert 5-10x higher (if offer is right)
- **Referral rate:** Often 40%+ (relationship networks are strong)

**Step 3: Learn (What does the data tell you?)**

Three possible learnings:

1. **Confirm:** The hypothesis is validated. What's the next hypothesis?
2. **Refine:** The core insight is right, but the implementation is wrong. Pivot execution.
3. **Invalidate:** The hypothesis is false. Kill it or pivot to new direction.

### Build-Measure-Learn Decision Framework

```
HYPOTHESIS: [state clearly]

MVP: [describe what you'll build]

METRIC: [what you'll measure]

SUCCESS: [target number]

IF TARGET MET:
- Next hypothesis: [what you'll test next]

IF TARGET NOT MET:
- Pivot option A: [adjust execution]
- Pivot option B: [adjust hypothesis]
- Kill option: [when to abandon]
```

## Framework 3: Marc Lou — 48-72 Hour Launch Validation

### Ship Fast, Measure Fast

Marc Lou validates ideas by shipping in 48 hours and measuring signal by day 2.

**48-Hour Launch Protocol:**

**Hour 0-4: Plan**
- Define hypothesis (1 sentence)
- List 10 people who must see this
- Identify 1 metric that proves signal

**Hour 4-16: Build**
- Create landing page OR MVP (choose one, not both yet)
- Landing page tools: Carrd, Webflow, Framer
- MVP tools: Zapier, n8n, no-code automation
- For MENA: WhatsApp bot via Make or n8n

**Hour 16-24: Launch**
- Email to 10 warm connections
- Post 1 social post
- Ask for intro to 3 more people
- DO NOT optimize, DO NOT polish

**Hour 24-48: Measure**
- Check metrics
- Respond to every message personally
- Collect feedback via voice messages (MENA preference)

**Hour 48-72: Decide**
- MRR signal? ($100+ MRR or 5+ paying users = SIGNAL)
- Email engagement? (30%+ open rate = SIGNAL)
- Community interest? (10+ DMs asking for access = SIGNAL)

**SIGNAL = Go deeper**
**NO SIGNAL = Kill or pivot by EOD**

### Why 48-72 Hours?

- Fast enough to kill a bad idea before sunk costs
- Slow enough to get real feedback
- Creates urgency (better product decisions)
- Proves founder commitment (ships faster than talking about shipping)

## Framework 4: John Rush — Pre-Sell Before Building

### The Pre-Sell Rule: Don't Code Until 5 Pre-Pay

**Pre-sell validates demand before you waste engineering time.**

**Pre-Sell Process:**

**Step 1: Create Pre-Sell Landing Page**
```
Headline: [Problem + Solution]
Subheading: [Specific outcome they get]
Pain bullet points (3)
Desired outcome (1)
"Request Early Access" button
Pricing preview: "Early access: $100/mo"
Social proof (if you have 1-2 logos)
CTA: "Get early access"
```

**Step 2: Drive Traffic**
- Email your network (warm intro focus)
- Post 5 times on LinkedIn (authentic, not salesy)
- Ask 10 people for referrals
- Join 3 relevant communities (Discord, Slack groups)
- DO NOT run paid ads yet

**Step 3: Collect Pre-Pays**
- Every landing page visitor gets a personal follow-up
- Offer: "First 5 customers get 3 months for $99 (vs $300 normal price)"
- Use Stripe link directly (no signup required)
- Take PayPal for MENA founders (higher conversion)

**Step 4: Kill Decision**
- **0-1 pre-pays:** Product doesn't solve real problem. KILL.
- **2-3 pre-pays:** Demand exists but messaging wrong. REFINE.
- **4-5 pre-pays:** Demand is real. NOW you build.
- **6+ pre-pays:** You have product-market fit before building. BUILD.

**Pre-Sell Messaging (MENA Adapted):**

```
Subject: I'm working on something for MENA founders like you

Body:
Hey [Name],

I'm validating an idea and would love your input.

Problem: MENA founders spend 40+ hours building the wrong GTM before they find what works.

Idea: A 3-Day GTM Sprint (community + framework + feedback) that gets founders profitable in 30 days.

I'm looking for 5 early access customers to prove this works.
If you're interested, I'm offering 3 months for $99 (normally $300).

Reply if interested or refer me to a founder who might be.

—[Your name]
```

## Framework 5: Tibo — Audience-First Validation

### The Audience is Your MRR

Don't build for a hypothetical customer—build for the 100 people watching your journey.

**Audience-First Validation Process:**

**Week 1: Announce the Problem**
- Post 5 times about the problem you're solving
- Don't mention your solution yet
- Ask: "How are YOU currently solving [problem]?"
- Engagement = signal that audience cares

**Week 2: Share Your Thinking**
- Build in public: "Here's my hypothesis..."
- Share customer interviews publicly (anonymized)
- Ask: "What am I missing?"
- Refine hypothesis based on comments

**Week 3: Show Prototype**
- Post video walkthrough of MVP (doesn't need to work perfectly)
- Ask: "Would you use this?"
- Measure comment rate (target: 5%+ comment rate on video)

**Week 4: Pre-Sell to Audience**
- Announce: "I'm taking 5 early customers..."
- Offer special pricing for audience members
- Measure: How many respond within 48 hours?

**Weekly Content Calendar (Tibo Style):**

| Day | Content | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Monday | Problem validation post | Engage audience |
| Tuesday | Customer story (anonymized) | Build credibility |
| Wednesday | Your thinking (behind-the-scenes) | Transparency |
| Thursday | Call for feedback | Crowdsource ideas |
| Friday | Weekly update (wins + learnings) | Build momentum |

**MENA-Specific Audience Building:**

- **WhatsApp channel > LinkedIn followers:** Post updates in WhatsApp channel (more loyal audience)
- **Weekly community call > async content:** Synchronous calls create stronger bonds (use WhatsApp video call)
- **Build in Arabic:** Audience-first means language-first
- **Celebrate student wins:** Your audience's success is your best marketing

## 14-Day Validation Sprint Template

Use this to run your own validation sprint:

### Days 1-2: Plan
- Hypothesis (1 sentence)
- 10 target customers
- Success metric and target

### Days 3-5: Customer Development
- 10 interviews minimum
- Interview script above
- Measure: Do 3+ show green flags?

### Days 6-7: MVP or Landing Page
- Choose: testable product OR landing page
- 48-hour build sprint
- Don't optimize, just launch

### Days 8-10: Launch + Measure
- Email 10 warm connections
- Social post 3x
- Measure primary metric
- Collect feedback

### Days 11-13: Pre-Sell
- Create landing page if not done
- Offer early access pricing
- Target: 5 pre-pays

### Day 14: Kill/Pivot Decision
```
DECISION MATRIX:

Interviews showed strong signal? (Y/N)
MVP/landing page got 10%+ engagement? (Y/N)
Got 3+ pre-pays? (Y/N)

Score:
- 3/3 = GO (build full product)
- 2/3 = REFINE (adjust hypothesis, do another 7-day sprint)
- 1/3 = PIVOT (change problem or target market)
- 0/3 = KILL (archive this idea, test next one)
```

## Kill Decision Framework (When to Quit)

Founders hate killing ideas. Use this to decide rationally:

**KILL if:**
- Fewer than 2 out of 10 interviews show genuine problem
- Less than 3% landing page opt-in rate after 100 visitors
- Zero pre-pays after targeting 10 warm connections
- Founder's passion has dropped (you hate working on it)

**PIVOT if:**
- Problem is real, but wrong target market
- Solution is right, but messaging is wrong
- Demand exists, but at higher price or lower price point
- Founder interest shifted to adjacent problem

**PERSEVERE if:**
- 4+ out of 10 show strong signal
- 5%+ landing page opt-in rate
- 3+ pre-pays from cold/warm outreach
- Founder's passion is increasing

## MENA-Specific Validation Adjustments

**Interview Medium:**
- Prefer WhatsApp voice calls over Zoom (less intimidating, higher conversion)
- Allow longer interviews (MENA culture prefers conversation over efficiency)
- Build relationships first, validation second

**Landing Page Localization:**
- Test Arabic-first vs. bilingual vs. English-first (don't assume English)
- WhatsApp button > Email signup (higher conversion in MENA)
- Pricing in local currency (AED/SAR, not USD)

**Pre-Sell Dynamics:**
- Higher pre-pay conversion (5-15% vs 1-3% global)
- BUT requires warm intro (cold pre-sell won't work)
- Family/business reference increases trust (mention mutual contacts)

**Audience Building:**
- WhatsApp channel growth faster than LinkedIn (reference network)
- Weekly community call is your #1 validation tool (direct feedback)
- Bilingual content performs differently (Arabic gets different audience than English)
