  "scoring", "quality gate", "ready to deploy", "ship check". Also triggers when
  reviewing ANY deliverable before deployment. The most important plugin in the
  stack; nothing ships without a score.

# Scoring Orchestrator

**Purpose:** Route scoring requests to the right specialist scorer, enforce hard stops, compute composite Campaign Health, and track improvement priority.

This is the quality gate for SMOrchestra.ai's GTM output. Every campaign asset, every piece of copy, every social post, every YouTube video, every LinkedIn post passes through this system before shipping. The premise: systematic scoring against expert-grade benchmarks catches quality problems that intuition misses. A 7.0 floor with hard stop enforcement means nothing mediocre gets to market.

## How Scoring Works

### Step 1: Identify What's Being Scored

When the user presents content for scoring, determine which system applies:

| Content Type | Scoring System | Skill to Invoke |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Campaign plan, outbound strategy, GTM architecture | System 1: Campaign Strategy | campaign-strategy-scorer |
| Offer structure, pricing, positioning statement, value prop | System 2: Offer & Positioning | offer-positioning-scorer |
| Cold email, VSL script, LinkedIn DM, WhatsApp message | System 3: Copywriting | copywriting-scorer |
| Organic social post (LinkedIn/Twitter/Instagram) | System 4: Social Media | social-media-scorer |
| YouTube thumbnail, title, script, or description | System 5: YouTube | youtube-scorer |
| LinkedIn personal brand post (English B2B or Arabic EO) | System 6: LinkedIn Branding | linkedin-branding-scorer |
| Lead magnet, scorecard, quiz, self-assessment, diagnostic tool, ROI calculator | System 7: Scorecard Effectiveness | scorecard-effectiveness |

If the content spans multiple systems (e.g., "score my entire campaign"), run each applicable scorer and then compute the composite.

### Step 2: Route to Specialist Scorer

Each scorer is an independent skill with its own criteria, weights, descriptors, and benchmarks. The orchestrator does not contain scoring logic; it routes and aggregates.

When routing:
1. Read the content or ask the user to paste/upload it
2. Identify the correct scorer(s)
3. Invoke the scorer skill
4. Collect the output (score JSON + narrative assessment)

### Step 3: Enforce Hard Stops

After each scorer returns results, check hard stop rules from `references/score-bands.md`:

- **Rule 1:** Any criterion below 5.0 = mandatory rework (blocks shipping)
- **Rule 2:** Primary channel scoring below 6.0 = deployment blocked
- **Rule 3:** MENA-targeted deliverables must score 6.0+ on MENA Contextualization

If hard stops trigger, report them prominently. Do not bury them in the narrative.

### Step 4: Compute Composite (Multi-System Scoring)

When scoring a full campaign across multiple systems, calculate Campaign Health using the formula in `references/composite-formula.md`:

```
Campaign Health = (Campaign Strategy x 0.25) +
                  (Offer/Positioning x 0.20) +
                  (Best Copywriting Subsystem x 0.25) +
                  (Social Media x 0.15) +
                  (YouTube OR LinkedIn x 0.15)
```

Normalize weights for systems not scored.

**Worked example:**

Campaign: Q2 MENA SaaS expansion
- Campaign Strategy: 8.5
- Offer/Positioning: 8.7
- Email Copy (primary channel): 8.2
- LinkedIn Posts (authority layer): 7.8
- YouTube: not scored (no video assets this campaign)

Applicable weights: 0.25 + 0.20 + 0.25 + 0.15 = 0.85 (YouTube excluded)

Normalized weights:
- Strategy: 0.25 / 0.85 = 0.294
- Offer: 0.20 / 0.85 = 0.235
- Email: 0.25 / 0.85 = 0.294
- LinkedIn: 0.15 / 0.85 = 0.176

Campaign Health = (8.5 × 0.294) + (8.7 × 0.235) + (8.2 × 0.294) + (7.8 × 0.176)
= 2.499 + 2.045 + 2.411 + 1.373
= **8.33 / 10 — YELLOW (Deploy with monitoring)**

Weakest link: LinkedIn Posts at 7.8. Fix: sharpen authority signal and contrarian angle.
Strongest asset: Offer/Positioning at 8.7. The value prop is clear; copy and content need to express it better.

### Step 5: Assign Improvement Priority

Using the 7-level matrix in `references/composite-formula.md`, assign the improvement priority level (P0-P6) and recommend the single highest-impact fix.

## Scoring Protocol

### Before Scoring: Context Check

Before scoring any deliverable, establish:
1. **Target market:** MENA, US, EU, or multi-market? (changes MENA context weight)
2. **ICP:** Who is this for? (changes relevance of criteria)
3. **Campaign context:** Is this standalone or part of a larger campaign? (determines whether composite scoring applies)
4. **Business line:** SMOrchestra consulting, SalesMfast Signal Engine, SalesMfast SME, CXMfast, or EO? (changes benchmarks)

<!-- [Compiled: methodology section stripped — SMOrchestra.ai proprietary] -->
### Cross-System Dependency Protocol

When a scorer flags a criterion below 6.0, check the cross-system dependency table in that scorer's SKILL.md. If the dependency traces upstream:

1. Report the low score on the downstream criterion
2. Flag the upstream dependency: "This score is likely a symptom. Root cause: [upstream system] > [upstream criterion]"
3. Recommend fixing upstream first before re-scoring downstream
4. In the improvement roadmap, order the fix as: upstream fix → downstream re-score → downstream fix (if still needed)

### System Disagreement Protocol

When upstream and downstream systems show contradictory scores (e.g., Offer scores 9.0 but Copywriting scores 5.0), diagnose:

| Pattern | Likely Cause | Action |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Strategy high, Copy low | Good plan, poor execution | Fix copy. Strategy is sound. |
| Strategy low, Copy high | Polished lipstick on a pig | Fix strategy first. Good copy on bad strategy wastes it. |
| Offer high, Copy low | Strong value prop, weak articulation | Copy fix. The raw material exists. |
| Offer low, Copy high | Great writing, nothing to say | Fix offer. No amount of wordsmithing saves a weak offer. |
| Offer high, Social/YouTube low | Product-market fit exists, visibility gap | Fix content. The offer sells when people hear it. |
| All systems 6-7 | Mediocre everything, nothing great | Pick the highest-weighted system and push it to 9.0. One excellent system lifts the composite more than incremental improvement across all. |

**Rule of thumb:** When scores disagree, always fix upstream first. Strategy feeds Offer feeds Copy feeds Social/YouTube. A downstream fix on an upstream problem is temporary.

### After Scoring: Track and Trend

If the workspace has a `scores/` directory, append the JSON output. Over time, this creates a scoring history that reveals:
- Which systems consistently score lowest
- Which criteria are perennial weak spots
- Whether scores are trending up or down after process changes

### Score Presentation Guidelines

When presenting scores to the user:

1. **Lead with the verdict**, not the number. "This campaign is ready to ship with monitoring" > "Your score is 8.33."
2. **Always present the full criteria table.** Even when all criteria are green, the table shows what's working.
3. **Top 3 fixes are mandatory** for any score below 9.0. Each fix must include: which criterion, what to do specifically, and estimated point lift.
4. **Hard stops are highlighted first**, before any narrative. Use bold or emphasis.
5. **Offer to fix.** After every score report, offer to implement the #1 fix immediately. "Want me to rewrite the opening line with a timeline hook? That should lift C2 by 1-2 points."
6. **Save JSON.** If in a project workspace, always save the score JSON. Trends matter more than individual scores.

## Reference Files

Read these as needed during scoring:
- `references/score-bands.md` — Score interpretation, hard stop rules, verdict mapping
- `references/benchmarks-2026.md` — Current benchmark data for all channels
- `references/composite-formula.md` — Campaign Health calculation and Improvement Priority Matrix

---

## Interaction Pattern

When a user asks for scoring:

1. **Immediate:** "What are we scoring?" If obvious from context, skip the question and state what you're about to score.
2. **Load content:** Read the deliverable (from file, pasted text, or conversation context).
3. **Route:** Invoke the appropriate scorer skill(s).
4. **Report:** Present the score report in the format above.
5. **Fix:** If score is below 8.0, offer to implement the top fix immediately. If hard stops trigger, implement fixes before anything else.
6. **Save:** If in a project workspace, save the JSON output.

Do not ask "shall I score this?" when the user clearly wants scoring. Score it.
