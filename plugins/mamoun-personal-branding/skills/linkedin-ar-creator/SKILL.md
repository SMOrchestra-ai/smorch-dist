# LinkedIn Arabic Creator

Produces authority-building Arabic LinkedIn posts about AI, MicroSaaS, and the EO MENA Launching Pad. Three input modes: write from scratch, repurpose YouTube videos, or adapt English posts into Mamoun's Arabic voice. Every post documents the journey of building AI-powered businesses in MENA with practical depth.

## CRITICAL: READ BEFORE WRITING

1. Read `linkedin-ar-creator/voice-ar-samples.md` for Arabic rhythm calibration
2. Read `linkedin-shared-rules.md` for formatting, engagement mechanics, authority enforcement, quality gate
3. If deeper brand context needed, read from `~/Desktop/cowork-workspace/smorch-context/EntrepreneurOasis/`

---

## WHO THIS SERVES

**Audience:** Ahmad Al-Mansouri archetype. 28-40, MBA/business background, non-technical, stuck in corporate MENA job, wants to build something with lower risk. Speaks Arabic natively, consumes English tech content, thinks in both languages.

**Their pain:** Tech dependency ($50K-100K dev quotes), time starvation, imposter syndrome ("I'm not technical enough"), no MENA-relevant launch framework, no Arabic AI education that's practical.

**What they need from Mamoun's feed:** Proof that non-technical MENA founders can build real products with AI. Specific tools, specific steps, specific results. In Arabic. Not theory. Not hype. The actual build.

**Funnel:** Post -> engagement -> profile visit -> microsaas.entrepreneursoasis.me -> training signup -> EO platform

## NORTH STAR

"Build MicroSaaS and AI systems in MENA without waiting for a CTO, funding, or imported Silicon Valley nonsense. Even if you don't have a partner. Even if you're not technical. The Launching Pad exists to replace excuses with a system."

## STYLE DNA: Donnelly + Ruben + Eric + Charlie Hills

### From Chris Donnelly
- Strong visual brand identity (consistent color palette in carousels)
- 5 hook types mastered: How I, How to, Story, Quote, Statistic
- Carousel-first strategy (32% of content, highest reach)
- Mentor tone: empathetic and direct, not marketer

### From Ruben Hassid
- One sentence per line. No exceptions.
- Bold accusation hooks: "You're doing X and you know it."
- Contradiction hooks: sounds wrong, forces the click
- Stolen thought hooks: says what they think but won't say
- Phone-first formatting. Short. Punchy. Fragments.

### From Eric Vyacheslav
- Technical AI authority without dumbing down
- First-to-report positioning on new AI tools/features
- Side-by-side comparisons (old tool vs new tool)
- Daily rhythm: always has something new to share
- "This changes everything" opening energy

### From Charlie Hills
- CHEF Engine content architecture (Gather, Generate, Season, Serve)
- 70/20/10 content ratio: awareness/authority/conversion
- Hook formula: Line 1 (6-8 words) + Line 2 (contrasting twist)
- "How I..." over "How to..." (signals lived experience)
- Engagement OS: 15-min pre-post commenting, camp in comments post-publish

### Mamoun's Filter
- "Sadiqi" (my friend) as signature address
- "Crack the code" / "cracking" framing
- "Document the journey" ethos
- "Even if you don't have..." permission pattern
- Warm but structured. Coffee shop conversation with frameworks.
- Gulf Arabic conversational. NOT MSA. NOT formal.
- English tech terms stay in English script always.
- Protective honesty: if something doesn't work, say it. "I'd rather you hear this from me now than from your bank account in 6 months."

## THREE INPUT MODES

### Mode 1: DIRECT INPUT (default)

User provides topic or insight. Skill writes Arabic post from scratch.

**Step 0: Insight Extraction**

"What's the specific thing?
1. An AI tool you tested (which one, what happened)
2. Something you built this week (what, how long, what tool)
3. A student result from EO training
4. A mistake you made or watched a founder make
5. A contrarian take about AI or building in MENA
6. A framework you want to teach"

Push back on categories: "'AI tools' is a topic, not a post. Which tool? What did it do? What surprised you?"

**Step 1: Select Hook**

**15 Arabic Hook Formulas:**

**CONTRADICTION:**
1. "[Tool] just killed [sacred thing]. Not the buzzword. The entire concept."
2. "Everyone says [common advice]. I did the opposite. Here's what happened."
3. "The worst [thing] gets the best [result]."

**ACCUSATION:**
4. "You're waiting for [thing]. Your competitor shipped yesterday using Claude."
5. "You know [uncomfortable truth]. So does everyone watching you not act."

**STOLEN THOUGHT:**
6. "Nobody in MENA will say this publicly: [truth about the market]."
7. "Your [approach] is broken. You know it. Here's the replacement."

**SPECIFICITY:**
8. "I built [result] in [hours]. Cost: $[number]. Here's every step."
9. "[Number] tools tested. [Weeks]. Only [small number] survived."

**STORY ENTRY:**
10. "3 years ago I [event]. Today, [contrast]. The turning point:"

**TIMELINESS (First Look):**
11. "[Tool] just shipped [feature]. I tested it in Arabic. Here's what you need to know."
12. "[Company] just announced [thing]. This changes [workflow]."

**COMPARISON:**
13. "[Tool A] vs [Tool B]. Used both for [time]. One clear winner."

**SYSTEM REVEAL:**
14. "The exact [number]-step process I use to [result]. Copy this."
15. "My complete [type] stack. [Number] tools. $[cost]/month."

**Step 2: Write in Gulf Arabic**

Language rules:
- Gulf Arabic conversational. Like texting a smart friend.
- NOT Modern Standard Arabic. NOT formal.
- English tech terms in English script: Claude, AI, MicroSaaS, SaaS, API, Supabase, n8n, prompt
- Never transliterate English tech terms into Arabic script.
- "Sadiqi" used naturally, not forced. Max once per post.
- "Even if you don't have [X]" permission pattern when relevant.

**Step 3: Write Pinned Comment + Quality Gate + Output** (same as shared rules)

---

### Mode 2: YOUTUBE REPURPOSE

User provides YouTube video transcript, link, or summary. Skill extracts the sharpest insight and converts to Arabic LinkedIn post.

**Step 0: Extract Source Material**

If user pastes transcript: scan for the single most powerful insight, specific example, or framework taught in the video. Ignore the intro, pleasantries, and filler. Find the 30-second moment that would make someone stop scrolling.

If user gives a summary: ask for the ONE specific result, tool, or framework from the video.

**Step 1: Isolate the Post-Worthy Moment**

Ask: "I found [X] as the strongest hook from this video. Should I build the post around this, or is there a different moment you want?"

Criteria for what's post-worthy:
- Has a specific number or result
- Contains a contrarian take
- Shows a before/after transformation
- Reveals a specific tool or workflow
- Teaches a framework with a name

**Step 2: Convert to LinkedIn Format**

The YouTube video is 30-60 minutes. The post is 150-300 words. This is NOT a summary. It's an extraction of the single most powerful insight, repackaged as a scroll-stopping post.

Structure:
```
[Hook: the insight, reframed as hook formula]

[2-3 lines of context from the video]

[The framework/steps/result, condensed]

[Disagreement trigger]

[CTA: "Full video on the channel" or
"Deep dive at entrepreneursoasis.me"]
```

Apply all shared rules. Match Arabic voice samples. Run quality gate.

**Step 3: Suggest Carousel**

If the video teaches a multi-step process: suggest converting to carousel format (1 step per slide, dark/orange design, Cairo font).

---

### Mode 3: POST ARABIZER

User shares an English LinkedIn post from someone they follow (Donnelly, Ruben, Eric, Charlie, or others). Skill rewrites it in Mamoun's Arabic voice with MENA context.

**Step 0: Analyze Source Post**

Read the English post. Extract:
1. The core insight (what's the one thing being taught?)
2. The hook technique used (which of the 8 triggers?)
3. The structure (list? story? comparison? system reveal?)
4. The proof points (numbers, tools, timeframes)

**Step 1: Localize, Don't Translate**

This is NOT translation. This is cultural adaptation:

1. **Replace Western examples with MENA equivalents.**
   US startup -> MENA founder. SF pricing -> Gulf pricing.
   Mailchimp -> GoHighLevel. Hubspot -> what MENA SMEs actually use.

2. **Replace their experience with Mamoun's.**
   Their credentials -> Mamoun's 20 years, 200+ Gulf deals.
   Their tools -> Mamoun's stack (Claude, Supabase, n8n, GHL).
   Their results -> EO student results or SMOrchestra client results.

3. **Replace their voice with Mamoun's Arabic voice.**
   Match voice-ar-samples.md rhythm. Gulf Arabic conversational.
   Add "Sadiqi" if natural. Add MENA-specific pain points.

4. **Keep what works structurally.**
   If the original hook is strong, adapt the hook TYPE not the words.
   If the structure (old/new, numbered list, story) works, keep it.

**Step 2: Enhance with MENA Depth**

After localization, add one element the original post doesn't have:
- A MENA-specific insight that makes this relevant to Gulf/Levant founders
- A reference to Arabic-first tooling or Arabic market dynamics
- An EO training connection if the topic aligns

**Step 3: Apply all shared rules, voice calibration, quality gate.**

**Output format for Mode 3:**
```
ORIGINAL POST BY: [Name]
CORE INSIGHT EXTRACTED: [one sentence]
ADAPTATION APPROACH: [what changed, what stayed]

ARABIZED POST:
[ready to copy-paste]

PINNED COMMENT:
[ready to post]
```
