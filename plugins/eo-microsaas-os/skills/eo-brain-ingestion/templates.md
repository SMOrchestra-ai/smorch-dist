## GAP-FILL PROTOCOL

Two output files require data beyond what the scorecards provide: **brandvoice.md** and **competitor-analysis.md**.

### brandvoice.md Gap-Fill

After extracting everything available from SC1 Q6 (founder story) and SC1 writing style, ask these questions:

**Q1:** "I have your origin story and archetype from the scorecards. Now I need your brand voice. When you write content (LinkedIn, YouTube, emails), which 3 words describe your tone? Examples: direct, provocative, educational, warm, technical, conversational, formal."

**Q2:** "Give me an example of something you have written that you think represents your best voice. A LinkedIn post, email, YouTube intro, anything. Paste it here."

**Q3:** "What words or phrases should I NEVER use when writing for your brand? Things that make you cringe or feel off-brand."

Maximum 3 questions. If the student gives short answers, work with what you have. Do not over-ask.

### competitor-analysis.md Gap-Fill

SC1 Q4 gives competitive alternatives, but the analysis needs more depth. Ask:

**Q1:** "The scorecards mention these competitors: [list from SC1 Q4]. Are there any MENA-specific competitors or alternatives I should add? Anyone operating in the same space in Saudi, UAE, Egypt, or Jordan?"

**Q2:** "For your top 2 competitors: what is their biggest weakness that your ICP complains about? What do they get wrong?"

**Q3 (optional, only if pricing data is missing from SC3):** "Do you know what your top competitors charge? Rough pricing is fine."

Maximum 3 questions. If SC3 already has competitor pricing data, skip Q3.
