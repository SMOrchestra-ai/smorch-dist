# Decision Protocol

Every EO training build requires these decisions to be closed before any deliverable production begins. No "TBD" allowed in the Training Macro.

## Required Decisions

### 1. Training Topic & Belief Arc
**Question:** What does this training teach, and what 3-4 belief shifts does it create?
**Default pattern:** Start with the limiting belief MENA founders hold, end with the capability belief the training proves.
**How to close:** Mamoun provides the topic. Claude proposes the belief arc based on the topic and ICP. Mamoun approves or refines.

### 2. Target Audience (ICP)
**Question:** Who exactly is this for? Named personas, not segments.
**Default:** Expert-to-founder MENA solopreneurs. 5-20 years domain expertise. Not developers. No technical co-founders.
**Must include:** 3+ named example personas with city, age, industry, specific pain.
**How to close:** Claude proposes personas from MENA market knowledge. Mamoun validates against real people he knows.

### 3. Duration & Format
**Question:** How many hours? What's the free/paid split?
**Default pattern:** ~1h free lead magnet + ~3h paid training = ~4h total.
**Recording format default:** Camera-on-Mamoun + Loom screen recording, team post-production mixing.
**How to close:** Mamoun confirms or adjusts based on content depth.

### 4. Pricing Ladder
**Question:** What does it cost? What tiers exist?
**Default pattern (proven):**
- Founding Builders (10 spots): low founding price + community free for 12mo. Mutual commitment: 2+ calls/mo, share journey, testimonial in 60 days.
- Founding 50 (remaining 40): same founding price + 50% off community subscription. 4-week window.
- Full Price: training + 12mo community at premium price. Community renews at monthly rate after Year 1.

**How to handle:** Push back if Mamoun underprices for the Gulf market. $27 training is a low-decision entry point; community at $47/mo signals professional quality. Don't let founding discounts undermine perceived value.

### 5. Community Platform
**Question:** Where does the community live?
**Default:** SalesMfast (GHL-based community platform). This is the standard unless Mamoun explicitly changes it.
**Community benefits default:** Weekly 30-min Q&A, guest experts, access to future trainings, peer accountability.

### 6. Tool Landscape
**Question:** What tools are covered in the training? What complementary tools get mentioned?
**Pattern:** One primary tool ecosystem (e.g., Claude surfaces). Complementary tools get a decision tree mention, not a deep dive.
**Decision tree format:** Primary = [main tool]. Others = rapid prototypes / IDE iteration / browser scripts. 2-minute coverage.

### 7. Live Throughline
**Question:** What platform/product is built LIVE during recording?
**This is critical.** The live throughline is the 4-layer meta-learning architecture in action. The product must be real, shippable, and relevant to the training audience.
**How to close:** Mamoun names the product. Claude validates it can be built progressively across all steps.

### 8. Training Language
**Question:** What language for delivery? What language for assets?
**Default (locked):** Arabic delivery. Assets built in English first, then Arabized.
**This decision is closed by default.** Only reopen if Mamoun explicitly requests a different language approach.

## Decision Handling Rules

1. **Never leave a decision open.** If Mamoun hasn't addressed it, propose a default with reasoning and ask for confirmation.
2. **Push back on first answers.** Mamoun values contrarian input. If a number seems wrong, say so.
3. **Close means close.** Once confirmed, move the decision to the "ALL DECISIONS (Closed)" section. Do not revisit unless Mamoun explicitly asks.
4. **Cascade changes.** A single decision change (e.g., pricing) may affect positioning, community model, VSL script, landing page, and outbound sequences. Update everything downstream.
5. **Document the reasoning.** Each closed decision in the Macro should include the "why" (1 sentence), not just the "what."
