# Solution Architecture Scorer

Score architecture decisions, data design, and production readiness. This is Hat 2 of the 5-Hat Quality Scorecard System.

The core question: **Will this architecture survive production, scale, and the inevitable change requests?**

## When This Fires
- Composite scorer runs this as Hat 2
- User asks to "score architecture", "evaluate tech stack", "system design review"
- Architecture artifacts exist (schema files, API routes, config files, docker/deploy configs)
- Skip if: no code written yet (pre-build phase only needs product-scorer)

## Scoring Process

### Step 1: Discover Architecture

Search the codebase for architecture signals. Read in priority order:

1. **Schema**: `**/schema*`, `**/migrations/**`, `**/prisma/**`, `**/supabase/**/*.sql`, `**/drizzle/**`
2. **API layer**: `**/api/**`, `**/routes/**`, `**/trpc/**`, `**/graphql/**`
3. **Config**: `**/docker*`, `**/nginx*`, `**.env.example`, `**/vercel.json`, `**/next.config*`
4. **Auth**: `**/auth/**`, `**/middleware*`, `**/lib/auth*`
5. **Docs**: `**/architecture*`, `**/ADR*`, `**/decisions/**`, `**/docs/**`
6. **Infra**: `**/terraform/**`, `**/cloudformation/**`, `**/Dockerfile*`

Also check `package.json` for the dependency graph (framework, ORM, auth library, etc.)

### Step 2: Score Each Dimension

Read `references/architecture-anchors.md` for detailed rubrics. For calibration reference, see `../composite-scorer/references/calibration-examples.md` (Architecture section). For each dimension:

1. State what evidence you found (or didn't)
2. Cite specific files, configs, and patterns observed
3. Assign score 1-10 using anchor rubrics
4. Identify the specific gap to reach 8+

| Dimension | Weight | What to Investigate |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| BRD Traceability | 15% | Can architecture decisions be traced to requirements? ADRs exist? |
| Data Architecture | 15% | Schema design, normalization, indexes, RLS, migrations, relationships |
| API & Integration | 15% | Endpoint consistency, error format, versioning, external service patterns |
| Security Architecture | 15% | Auth flow, authorization model, secrets management, OWASP coverage |
| Scalability Design | 10% | Bottleneck awareness, caching strategy, connection pooling |
| Failure Mode Design | 10% | Error strategy, health checks, retry logic, graceful degradation |
| Cost Architecture | 10% | Hosting cost awareness, free tier usage, cost-per-user modeling |
| Documentation Quality | 10% | System diagrams, ADRs, setup guides, dependency documentation |

### Step 3: Stack-Specific Heuristics

For **Supabase** projects, check specifically:
- RLS policies on every table (`grep -r "CREATE POLICY" or check supabase/migrations`)
- Real-time subscriptions design (which tables, what triggers)
- Edge functions vs server-side patterns
- Database function usage (any business logic in postgres functions?)

For **Next.js** projects, check:
- Server vs client component split (look for 'use client' directives)
- API route organization (route handlers vs server actions)
- Middleware usage (auth, redirects, headers)
- ISR/SSG/SSR strategy per route

For **n8n** integrations, check:
- Webhook endpoints and security (auth headers, IP filtering)
- Error workflow patterns (do workflows have error handlers?)
- Credential management approach

### Step 4: Output Format

```
## Architecture Scorecard — [Project Name]
Phase: [phase] | Date: [date] | Stack: [detected stack]

### Category Score: X.X / 10 ([grade])

| Dimension | Score | Key Finding |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| BRD Traceability | X/10 | [evidence] |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Architecture Strengths
- [specific strength with file reference]

### Critical Gaps
- [Dimension]: Currently X, target 8+. Action: [specific fix]

### Hard Stops
- Security Architecture < 5: [PASS/FAIL]
```

### Security Hard Stop

Security Architecture scoring below 5 is a **hard stop** regardless of composite score. Check:
- API keys not in source code (grep for patterns: `sk-`, `api_key`, `secret`, `password`)
- Auth middleware on protected routes
- RLS policies active (not disabled)
- CORS configuration restrictive (not `*`)
- Input validation present on API endpoints

### Skip Conditions

Do NOT run this scorer when:
- **No codebase exists (pure ideation stage)**: No architecture to evaluate. Return "N/A: pre-code phase. Run product-scorer only."
- **Content-only project** (markdown docs, course materials): Architecture scoring doesn't apply.
- **Single static HTML file**: No architectural decisions to evaluate.
